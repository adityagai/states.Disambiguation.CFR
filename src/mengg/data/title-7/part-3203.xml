             If the condition of the property is acceptable, the recipient or
            its designated organization will coordinate with the USDA contact
            for transfer of the property. Since the USDA agency office may have
            several requests for property, it is critical that the recipient or
            its designated organization contact USDA as soon as possible.
            Property will usually be allocated on a first-come, first-served
            basis, taking into account fair and equitable distribution of excess
            computers or other technical equipment to all eligible recipients.

             Prior to transferring any property pursuant to this Act, the
            transferring agency must remove data from the excess computers or
            other technical equipment (memory or any kind of data storage
            device) according to accepted sanitization procedures. To the
            maximum extent practicable, the transferring agency must remove data
            using a means that does not remove, disable, destroy, or otherwise
            render unusable the excess computers or other technical equipment or
            components. It is imperative that agencies take the necessary steps
            to ensure that no personal computer, server, external storage
            device, or related electronic component is transferred that might
            contain sensitive or confidential information. See Departmental
            Manual 3575-001, Security Controls in the System Life Cycle/System
            Development Life Cycle, for additional guidance.
