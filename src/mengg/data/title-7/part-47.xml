            Administrator within 9 months after the cause of action accrues; if
            the informal complaint is not to be made the basis of a claim for
            damages, it may be filed at any time within 2 years after the

            or recording is a true, correct, and complete transcript or
            recording of the testimony given at the hearing, except in such

            transmitted are all the exhibits received in evidence at the
            hearing, with such exceptions as the examiner shall specify. The

            at the appropriate places any words necessary to make the text
            conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the examiner.

            (excluding interest), the examiner, whenever he or she is of the
            opinion that proof may be fairly and adequately presented by use of
            the documentary procedure provided for in this section, shall
            suggest to the parties that they consent to the use of such
            procedure. Parties are free to consent to such procedure if they
            choose, and declination of consent will not affect or prejudice the
            rights or interests of any party. A party, if he or she has not
            waived oral hearing, may consent to the use of the documentary
            procedure on the condition that depositions rather than affidavits
            be used. In such case, if the other party agrees, depositions shall
            be required to be filed in lieu of verified statements. If any party
            who has not waived oral hearing does not consent to the use of the
            documentary procedure, the proceeding will be set for oral hearing.
            The suggestion that the documentary procedure be used need not
            originate with the examiner. Any party may address a request to the
            examiner asking that the documentary procedure be used.

            Secretary filed with the Hearing Clerk within 20 days after the date
            of service of the order. Every such petition shall state
            specifically the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided
            and the alleged errors. If the Secretary concludes that the
            questions raised by the petition have been sufficiently considered

            <PRTPAGE P='304' />
            shall dismiss the petition without service on the other party.
            Otherwise, the Secretary shall direct that a copy of the petition be
            served upon such party by the Hearing Clerk. The filing of a
            petition to rehear or reargue a proceeding, or to reconsider an
            order, shall automatically operate to set aside the order pending
            final action on the petition. Only one petition to rehear, reargue,
            or reconsider will be accepted from each party, except when a
            mathematical or typographical error appears in either the original
            decision and order or in the decision on reconsideration.
