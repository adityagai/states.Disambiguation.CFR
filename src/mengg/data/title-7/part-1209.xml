            known to be engaged in acts of dishonesty or willful misconduct, the

            from office. Further, without recommendation of the Council, a

            cause, including the failure by a member to submit reports or remit

            an exemption may be granted. The Council then will issue, if deemed
            appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person that is

            must provide an exemption number to the first handler in order not
            to be subject to collection of an assessment on mushrooms. First
            handlers and importers, except as otherwise authorized by the

            address along with the exemption number assigned by the Council.
            Importers who are exempt from assessment shall be eligible for
            reimbursement of assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service
