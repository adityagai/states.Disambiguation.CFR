             The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of

            administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment
            is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic
            shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator
            shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market
            administrator&apos;s own initiative or at the request of interested
            parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to
            the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If
            the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping
            percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall
            issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and
            invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an
            applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least
            one day before the effective date.
