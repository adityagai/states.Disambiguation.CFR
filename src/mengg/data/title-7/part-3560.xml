          for developing component replacement time tables, and (3) for
          estimating future component replacement costs. Life cycle cost
          analysis can be accomplished through various methods, such as;
          insurance actuary tables or Agency documentation of a component&apos;s

            undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks;

            which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which
            have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants.
            Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and
            do not have reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to
            essential community facilities such as water, sewerage removal,
            schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, may
            not be acceptable. Consistent with Federal law and Departmental
            Regulation, the Agency must conduct an environmental assessment and
            a civil rights impact analysis before a site can be accepted. Sites
            may be determined by the Agency to be unacceptable if any of the
            adverse conditions described in this paragraph exist.

          Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Agency is required to
          assess the potential impact of the proposed action on protected
          environmental resources. Measures to avoid or at least mitigate
          adverse impacts to protected resources may require a change in the
          site or project design. Therefore, a site cannot be approved until the

             For existing properties that do not have fully accessible units,
            the 5 percent requirement will apply when making substantial
            alterations as defined by UFAS. The UFAS defines substantial
            alteration as “alteration to any building or facility is to be
            considered substantial if the total cost for a twelve month period
            amounts to 50 percent or more of the full and fair cash value of the
            building * * *” UFAS further defines full and fair cash value as
            “the assessed valuation of a building or facility as recorded in the
            assessor&apos;s office of the municipality and as equalized at one
            hundred percent (100%) valuation, or the replacement cost, or the
            fair market value.” The 5 percent rule will also apply to repair or
            renovation work on a single unit. For instance, if a unit is damaged
            by fire and 
            <PRTPAGE P='584' />
            extensive repair is necessary, to the extent possible the unit is to
            be converted to a fully accessible unit.

             The variety of bedroom quantities of fully accessible units will be
            comparable to the variety of bedroom quantities of units which are
            not fully accessible. Borrowers will not, however, be required to
            exceed the 5 percent requirement simply to have an accessible unit
            of each bedroom quantity. In addition, accessible units should be
            distributed throughout the complex so not to concentrate the units
            in one location.

            which sets forth how the reserve account funds will meet the capital
            needs of the property over an acceptable 20-year period. The reserve
            account analysis is based on either a Capital Needs Assessment or
            life cycle cost analysis, provided and acceptable to Rural
            Development by the applicant. Adjustments may be made to the
            contribution amount at 5 or 10-year intervals, either through an
            updated Capital Needs Assessment or as part of the original life
            cycle cost analysis. The cost of conducting either a Capital Needs
            Assessment or life cycle cost analysis will be paid for by the
            applicant. The cost of the initial Capital Needs Assessment or life
            cycle cost analysis may be included in the loan financing.

            not meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It
            is expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred

            duplicate, obscure, or failure to disclose the true nature and cost
            of work performed for the services rendered will cause the Agency to
            deny budget requests for the services or issue a demand for recovery
            and reimbursement for unauthorized actions.

             A management plan is required for all projects. The management plan
            should describe administrative expenses paid from management agent
            fees or project operations. The management plan should provide job
            descriptions for the site manager, the management agent and other
            personnel. It is important that these documents accurately reflect
            the duties being performed by the various personnel. The management

            resulting from an award finding improper actions on the part of the
            owner or management agent is generally an inappropriate project
            expense. The party responsible generally pays such expenses for
            violating the standards or by their insurance carriers.

            process and will not penalize borrowers for less than 100 percent
            compliance as long as it is evident that the borrower is striving to
            achieve the standards listed in this paragraph. In addition, the
            Agency understands that although its multifamily housing portfolio

             Community leaders and special interest groups such as community,
            public interest, religious organizations, and organizations for the
            disabled must be contacted. Owners and managers of projects with
            fully accessible apartments must adopt suitable means to ensure that
            information regarding the availability of accessible units reaches
            eligible persons with disabilities. In addition, owners and managers
            of elderly housing must ensure that information regarding
            eligibility reaches people who are less than 62 years old but who
            are eligible because they are disabled. Appropriate contacts are
            with physical rehabilitation centers, hospitals, workshops for the
            disabled, commissions on aging, and veterans organizations.

            default. If a borrower fails to pay outstanding taxes and
            assessments, the Agency will pay the outstanding balance and charge
            the tax or assessment amount, assessed penalties, and any additional
            incurred costs to the borrower&apos;s Agency account.

             The Agency will require borrowers who have demonstrated an

            basis for the tenant and management relationship. Prior to Agency
            approval of occupancy rules, borrowers must provide written
            certification from their attorney that the housing project&apos;s
            occupancy rules are consistent with applicable Federal, state, and
            local laws, as well as Agency requirements, and the requirements of
            all programs participating in the housing project. Borrowers must
            obtain Agency approval of the occupancy rules prior to initial
            occupancy and obtain Agency approval prior to the implementation
            date of any subsequent modifications to the rules.

            project&apos;s receipt of a tenant application requiring
            accessibility features if another suitably sized unit without
            accessibility features is available in the project. If a suitably

            tenant may remain in the unit with accessibility features until the
            first available unit in the project becomes available and then must
            move within 30 days.

             Borrowers, in accordance with lease agreements, may terminate or
            refuse to renew a tenant&apos;s lease only for material
            non-compliance with the lease provisions, material non-compliance
            with the occupancy rules, or other good causes. Prior to terminating
            a lease, the borrower must give the tenant 
            <PRTPAGE P='618' />
            written notice of the violation and give the tenant an opportunity
            to correct the violation. Subsequently, termination may only occur
            when the incidences related to the termination are documented and
            there is documentation that the tenant was given notice prior to the
            initiation of the termination action that their activities would
            result in occupancy termination.

             In projects where tenants pay the utilities, borrowers must
            establish utility allowances for each size and type of rental unit
            in the housing project based on estimated utility costs. Borrowers
            must review utility allowances annually, adjust for accuracy, and
            submit any utility allowance changes to the Agency for approval. If
            no changes are needed, the borrower must notify the Agency that no
            changes were made. Documentation to justify utility allowances must
            be maintained in the housing project files.

             If borrowers use funds contributed from sources other than the

            reduce general operating and management expenses, housing project
            rents must be reduced to reflect the funding being used to offset
            housing project expenses. When funds contributed from sources other
            than the Agency are used for housing project expenses, the borrower
            must certify to the Agency, in writing, that the funds provided will
            not need to be repaid with Agency funds. Funds from borrower
            contributions or rehabilitation loans will not be counted towards
            reducing rents.

             The Agency may approve a change in the reserve account funding
            level based on the findings of an approved capital needs assessment.
            The approval to increase reserve account funding levels will take
            into consideration the housing project&apos;s approved budget and
            the housing project&apos;s ability to support increased reserve
            account deposits without causing basic rents to exceed conventional
            rents for comparable units in the area.

            diminish borrower operation and management responsibilities and do
            not relieve borrowers from any Agency requirements including, but
            not limited to, borrower requirements to comply with:

          Generally, the Agency will provide the borrower prior notice of an
          on-site monitoring review and will conduct the on-site monitoring
          review in the presence of the borrower. However, the Agency may visit
          a housing project, without prior notice, to observe physical
          conditions, operations and management activities, or other borrower or
          tenant activities. In addition, the Agency may conduct on-site reviews
          without the presence of the borrower, the management agent, or other
          designated representative of the borrower.

          The Agency will notify borrowers, in writing, whenever Agency
          monitoring activities result in deficiency findings or compliance
          violations. The monitoring review notification will describe the
          deficiencies findings or compliance violations and will specify a time
          period by which corrective action must be taken by the borrower. The
          notification will offer borrowers an opportunity to discuss the
          reported deficiency findings or compliance violations with the Agency
          and will explain enforcement actions that the Agency may take if
          corrective action is not taken within the time period specified in the
          monitoring review notification. When civil rights non-compliance is
          found, the State Civil Rights Coordinator or Manager (SCRC/M) will be
          notified. If voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, appropriate
          enforcement or remedial action will be taken.

            property previously operated as program property prior to becoming
            REO inventory property be sold as program property. However, REO
            property may be sold under whatever Agency program is most
            appropriate for the property and the community needs regardless of
            the program under which the property was originally financed or
            whether the property was being used to secure loans under more than
            one Agency program.

            energy conservation standards, it will disclose the basis for this
            determination to prospective purchasers. The deed by which such an
            REO property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from
            residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary, and meets
            the Agency&apos;s cost effective conservation standards. The Agency
            will also notify any potential purchaser of any known lead based
            paint hazards.

        <P>
          For off-farm labor housing operating on a seasonal basis, the
          management plan must establish specific opening and closing dates.
          During the off-season, off-farm labor housing may be used as defined
          in subpart A of this part under short-term lease provisions. Where
          rents are charged on a per-unit basis and family income qualifies the
          household for rental assistance, rental assistance may be used.

             When feasible, the on-farm labor housing will be located on a tract
            of land that is surveyed such that, for security purposes, it is
            considered separate and distinct from the farm. The security for the
            loan must include a lien on the tract of land where the on-farm
            labor housing is located and the security must have adequate value
            to protect the Federal government&apos;s interest. The Agency will
            seek a first or parity lien position on Agency-financed property in
            all instances, however, the Agency may accept a junior lien position
            if the Federal government&apos;s interests are adequately secured.

            received by a borrower or tenant, plus the cost of collection, to

            findings related to unauthorized assistance determinations will be

            assistance findings for suspension, debarment, civil or criminal
            action to the fullest extent permitted by law.

             Before a borrower notifies a tenant of rental assistance
            cancellation, the borrower must request Agency approval. If the
            Agency determines that the unauthorized rental assistance was
            received by the tenant due to borrower fraud or error, the borrower
            must give the tenant 30 days notice, in writing, that the unit was
            assigned in error and that the rental assistance benefit will be
            canceled effective on date that the next monthly rental payment is
            due after the end of the 30-day notice period.

             Tenants also must be notified, in writing, that they may cancel

            canceled. Tenants must be offered an opportunity to meet with a
            borrower to discuss the rental assistance cancellation.

             The Agency will use appraisals to determine whether the security
            offered by an applicant or borrower is adequate to secure a loan or
            determine appropriate servicing or preservation decisions.
            Appraisals used for Agency decision-making must be current, unless
            the Agency and the applicant, or borrower, mutually agree to the use
            of an appraisal that is not current. A current appraisal is an
            appraisal with a report date that is not more than one year old.

             “ ‘As-is’ value” means the value of the housing and related
            facilities as of the effective date of the appraisal. It relates to
            what physically exists and is legally permissible at the time of the
            appraisal and excludes all hypothetical conditions.

            appraisals, this date will typically be the projected completion
            date of proposed new construction or rehabilitation.

             The final opinion of value presented in an appraisal report must
            have considered a cost approach, a sales comparison approach, and an
            income approach. If one of these standard approaches is not used,
            the reconciliation narrative will provide a full and complete
            explanation of the reasons the approach was excluded. The
            reconciliation will fully discuss and reconcile variances in the
            value indications concluded by each approach.
