             (“Treasury rate”). In accordance with standard Treasury procedures,
            the rate in effect for any given day is the rate set at the close of
            business on the preceding day. The 30-year Treasury rate will be
            applied to all advances with a final maturity of at least 30 years
            from date of advance. A straight-line interpolation between other
            Treasury rates will be used to determine the rate applicable for
            advances with final maturities of less than 30 years.
