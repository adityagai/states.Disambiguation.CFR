            shall be accompanied by full instructions as to their markings and

            continue serving on the Board and such other candidates as may be

            only one ballot in the nomination and each vote shall be given equal

            revisions. If the reserve percentage is reduced when an export
            percentage is in effect, an increase shall be made in the export
            percentage so that the quantity previously authorized for export

            the quantity previously authorized for export the export percentage
            shall be 100 percent. Upon revision, all reserve obligations that
            are theretofore accrued on merchantable walnuts certified during
            such year on the basis of the previously effective percentages shall
            be adjusted accordingly.

            volume of reserve walnuts available for export and additional demand

            regulations for different market destinations. If the Secretary

             Before or upon handling of any walnuts for use as free or reserve
            walnuts, each handler at his or her own expense shall cause such
            walnuts to be inspected to determine whether they meet the then

            performed by the inspection service or services designated by the
            Board with the approval of the Secretary; Provided, That if more
            than one inspection service is designated, the functions performed
            by each service shall be separate, and shall not duplicate each
            other. Handlers shall obtain a certificate for each inspection and
            cause a copy of each certificate issued by the inspection service to
            be furnished to the Board. Each certificate shall show the identity
            of the handler, quantity of walnuts, the date of inspection, and for
            inshell walnuts the grade and size of such walnuts as set forth in
            the United States Standards for Walnuts (Juglans regia) in the
            Shell. Certificates covering reserve shelled walnuts for export

            regia). The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe

          The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds
          are reasonable and likely to be incurred by it during each marketing
          year for the maintenance and functioning of the Board, and for such
          other purposes as the Secretary may, pursuant to this part, determine
          to be appropriate. The Board shall file a proposed budget of expenses
          and a rate of assessment with the Secretary as soon as practicable
          after the beginning of each marketing year.

          representatives shall be permitted to inspect any walnuts held and any
          and all records of the handler with respect to matters within the
          purview of this part. Each handler shall maintain complete records on
          the receiving, holding, and disposition of both inshell and shelled
          walnuts. Each handler shall furnish all labor necessary to facilitate
          such inspections at no expense to the Board or the Secretary. Each
          handler shall store all walnuts held by him in such manner as to
          facilitate inspection and shall maintain adequate storage records
          which will permit accurate identification with respect to inspection
          certificates of respective lots and of all such walnuts held or
          disposed of theretofore. The Board, with the approval of the
          Secretary, may establish any methods and procedures needed to verify
          reports.

             Beginning September 1 of any marketing year, a handler may become
            an agent of the Board to dispose of reserve walnuts of such
            marketing year. The agency shall be established upon execution of an
            “Agency Agreement for 
            <PRTPAGE P='530' />
            Reserve Walnuts” setting forth the terms and conditions specified by

            walnuts for which the handler has agreed to undertake disposition
            pursuant to the Board&apos;s authority. Each lot of reserve or
            substandard walnuts delivered to the Board for pooling and
            disposition shall be separately weighed at the handler&apos;s
            expense by a public weighmaster either upon removal from the
            handler&apos;s premises or in transit to Board storage facilities or
            diversion point. A copy of each weighmaster&apos;s certificate
            showing the net weight of the walnuts shall be forwarded to the
            Board by the handler. Walnuts delivered to the Board shall be
            delivered F.O.B. handler&apos;s warehouse or point of storage.
