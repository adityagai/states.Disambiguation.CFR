             Generally, loan and grant disbursements may be requested on an as
            needed basis, thereby reducing the need for supervised bank
            accounts. For all construction loans and those loans using multiple
            advances, only the actual amount to be disbursed at loan closing
            will be requested through the automated systems. Subsequent
            disbursements will be ordered as needed. However, supervised bank
            accounts may be used in certain circumstances. For example:

             The debt instruments executed at the time of loan closing
            constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to disburse
            all funds at one time or in multiple advances, provided the funds
            are for purposes authorized by the Government at the time of loan
            closing. This obligatory commitment takes priority over any
            intervening liens or advances by other creditors, regardless of the

             Ordinarily, when deposits are made from funds which are received as
            the result of consent or subordination agreements or assignments of
            income, the check should be drawn to the order of the financial
            institution in which the supervised bank account is established or

             Ordinarily, a check will be countersigned before it is delivered to
            the payee. However, in justifiable circumstances, such as when
            excessive travel on the part of the borrower or Servicing Official
            would be involved, or purchase would be prevented, and the borrower
            can be relied upon to select goods and services in accordance with
            the plans, a check may be delivered to the payee by the borrower
            before being countersigned.

            each check; i.e., a negotiable demand draft drawn on a financial
            institution), the original cancelled check or either a copy or other
            reasonable facsimile of the cancelled check must be provided to the

            will be reconciled promptly with Servicing Office records. The
            person making the reconciliation will initial the record and
