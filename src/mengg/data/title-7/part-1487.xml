          Under the TASC program, CCC, an agency and instrumentality of the
          United States within the Department of Agriculture, provides funds to
          eligible organizations, on a grant basis, to implement activities that
          are intended to address a sanitary, phytosanitary, or related
          technical barrier that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S.
          specialty crops that are currently available on a commercial basis.
          The TASC program is intended to benefit the represented industry
          rather than a specific company or brand. This program is administered
          by FAS.

             In order to be eligible for funding under the TASC program,
            activities must address sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical
            barriers to export of specialty crops. Examples of expenses that CCC
            may agree to cover under the TASC program include, but are not
            limited to: initial pre-clearance programs, export protocol and work
            plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys,
            development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database
            development, reasonable logistical and administrative support, and
            travel and per diem expenses.

             Periodically the CCC will inform the public of the process by which
            interested eligible organizations may submit proposals for TASC
            program funding. This announcement will, among other things, include
            information on any deadlines for submitting proposals and the
            address of the office to which the proposals should be sent. The CCC
            also may announce the availability of a Quick Response Fund within
            the TASC program. Proposals submitted under any form of quick
            response process may be submitted at any time during the year but
            must meet the basic requirements of the program and any specific
            requirements of that particular process. Organizations interested in
            participating in the TASC program may submit their proposals
            electronically or in paper copy. Although no specific format is
            required, a sample format for proposals is available from the
            address provided in this rule.

            level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding
            recommendations to appropriate officials within FAS for decision.
            FAS may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal,
            request the assistance of other U.S. government experts in
            evaluating the merits of a proposal.

          Following the approval of a proposal, the CCC will enter into a
          written agreement with the organization that submitted the proposal.
          This program agreement will incorporate the proposal as approved by
          the FAS, include a maximum dollar amount that may be reimbursed (the
          funding level), and identify terms and conditions under which the CCC
          will reimburse certain costs of the project. Program agreements also
          will outline any specific responsibilities of the participant,
          including, but not limited to, the timely and effective implementation
          of program activities and the submission of a written report(s), on no
          less than an annual basis, which evaluates the TASC project using the
          performance measures presented in the approved proposal.

            by check made payable to the CCC no later than the 90th calendar day
            following the date of disbursement of the advance to the
            participant. Upon the expenditure of advance funds, participants
            must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance charged to
            them.
