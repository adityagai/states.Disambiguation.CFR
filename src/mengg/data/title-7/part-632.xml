             NRCS is to consult with State and local reclamation committees to
            obtain recommendations on program operation, evaluation of
            applications for reclamation assistance, and public participation.
            The NRCS State Conservationist is to use existing reclamation
            committees or encourage the organization of a new State committee
            for this purpose. The State Conservationist is to serve as a member
            when the committee is functioning for the purposes of this program.
            Representatives of the Office of Surface Mining, State reclamation
            agency, State water quality agency, State conservation agency, and
            other agencies or groups are to be invited to participate as
            members. Individual citizens may participate through the State
            committee. Local committees, if needed, are to be organized on a
            multicounty, county, conservation district, or other appropriate
            area with a local membership structure similar to the State
            committee. The district conservationist is to be a member of a local
            reclamation committee organized to provide program guidance.

          Lands and water eligible for reclamation are those that were mined for
          coal or were affected by coal-mining processes and were abandoned or
          inadequately reclaimed before August 3, 1977. These lands and water
          are not eligible if:

             There is continuing reclamation responsibility on the part of a
            mine operator, permittee, or agent under State or Federal law or on
            the part of the State as a result of bond forfeiture. However, if

          or their agents who own or have management control of eligible land
          and/or water are eligible to participate in the program. Residents or
          tenants who do not own the land must have control of the land for the
          period of the proposed contract and have the written consent of the
          landowner. Land users may participate by operating as persons,
          partnerships, associations, corporations, estates, trusts, or
          non-Federal public entities, and by acting individually or jointly
          with other eligible land users. However, joint participation with
          other eligible land users is required if the primary purpose of
          reclamation is enhancement of water quality or quantity.

            for the application of the land use and conservation treatment as
            scheduled in the reclamation plan according to approved standards
            and specifications. A land user may request NRCS to award and
            administer a contract to apply the conservation treatment as
            scheduled in the reclamation plan in accordance with

            The land user is to submit claims for payment to the district
            conservationist no later than September 30 of the year after
            application. Late claims require approval of the State
            conservationist before payment can be made. A claim is to show the
            proportion of each land user&apos;s contribution to the applied
            practice or identifiable unit.

             The land user who purchases materials or services to carry out a
            contract is responsible for them until the district conservationist
            determines that the material or service was used for the intended
            purpose. If a material or service cost-shared by NRCS is used for a
            purpose other than to carry out the contract, the land user is
            indebted to the United States for the cost of the misused material
            or service. This indebtedness is to be repaid to NRCS as a refund or
            withheld from cost-share payments otherwise due the land user under
            the contract.

             Federal cost-share payments made directly to suppliers of materials
            or services are credited to the land user who was issued the
            authorization. The remainder of the cost share is credited to the
            land user who carried out the remainder of the practice or
            identifiable unit. If more than one land user contributed to
            carrying out a practice or identifiable unit, the cost-share payment
            is to be divided proportionately according to the contribution made
            by each of the land users. Furnishing a landright or water right is
            not a contribution for cost-share payment purposes.

             Payment adjustments may include decreasing the rate of a cost
            share, deleting a cost-share commitment from the contract, or
            withholding cost-share payments earned but not paid. The land user
            who signs the contract may be obligated to refund cost-share
            payments and cost shares paid under authorizations.

             This section prescribes the regulations dealing with contract
            violations. The Chief reserves the right to revise or supplement any
            of the provisions of this section at any time if the action does not
            adversely affect the land user, or if the land user has been
            officially notified before this action is taken. No cost-share
            payment shall be made pending the decision on whether a contract
            violation has occurred.

             When the State conservationist is notified that a contract
            violation may have occurred that may warrant a penalty of
            forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment, or termination, he is to
            notify, in writing, each land user who signed the agreement of the
            alleged violation. This notice may be personally delivered or sent
            by certified or registered mail. A land user is considered to have 
            <PRTPAGE P='516' />
            received the notice at the time of personal receipt acknowledged in
            writing, at the time of the delivery of a certified or registered
            letter, or at the time of the return of a certified or registered
            letter where delivery was refused.

             The notice setting forth the nature of the alleged violation is to
            give the land user an opportunity to appear at a hearing before a
            hearing officer designated by the State conservationist. The land
            user&apos;s request for a hearing is to be submitted in writing and
            must be received in the NRCS field office within 30 days after
            receipt of the notice. The land user is to be notified in writing by
            the hearing officer of the time, date, and place for the hearing.
            The land user is to have no right to a hearing if he does not file a
            written request for a hearing, or if he or his representative does
            not appear at the appointed time, unless the hearing officer, at his
            discretion, permits an appearance. A request for a hearing filed by
            a land user is considered to be a request by all land users who
            signed the contract.

            Likewise, the United States may submit statements and evidence.
            Individuals not otherwise represented at the hearing may be
            permitted, at the discretion of the hearing officer, to give
            information of evidence. The hearing officer, at his discretion, may

            if both the land user and the State conservationist agree. A
            transcript of the hearing is to be made if requested by either the
            State conservationist or the land user within 10 days of the
            hearing. If a transcript is requested by the land user, the land
            user may be assessed the cost of a copy of the transcript.

             The State conservationist is to make a decision after considering

            conservation district board if any, and any other information
            available to him, including, if applicable, the amount of the
            forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment. The decision is to state
            whether the violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination
            of the contract. The State conservationist is to notify, in writing,
            each land user who signed the contract of his decision. The State
            conservationist may authorize or require the reopening of any
            hearing before a hearing officer for any reason at any time before
            his decision.

             Any land user affected by a decision of the State conservationist
            has the right of appeal to the Chief. The appeal and any briefs or
            statements must be received in the Office of the Chief within 30
            days after the land user has received notice of the State
            conservationist&apos;s decision. The State conservationist is to
            file a brief or statement in the Office of the Chief within 20 days
            after the land user&apos;s brief or statement is received there. The
            appeal is to be limited to the records and the issues made before
            the State conservationist. The Chief&apos;s decision is final. The
            decision is to be determined by the record before him and the issues
            presented in the appeal, and the land user is to be notified in
            writing.

             Environmental evaluation is an integral part of planning used by
            NRCS in developing each reclamation plan under this program.
            Planning includes site inventory and analysis, evaluation of
            reasonable alternatives, and identification of significant
            environmental impacts. Major points in planning when NRCS or the
            land user can make decisions concerning further action are:
