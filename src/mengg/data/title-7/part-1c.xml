            applies to all research involving human subjects conducted,
            supported or otherwise subject to regulation by any federal
            department or agency which takes appropriate administrative action
            to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes
            research conducted by federal civilian employees or military
            personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such
            procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an
            administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted,
            supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the federal
            government outside the United States.

            commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently

            in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In

            review specific research activities, the IRB shall be able to
            ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of

             Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are
            consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily
            expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using
            procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or

             Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated
            benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge
            that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and
            benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that
            may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and
            benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not
            participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible
            long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for
            example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as
            among those research risks that fall within the purview of its
            responsibility.

             Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the

          An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of
          research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&apos;s
          requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm
          to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a
          statement of the reasons for the IRB&apos;s action and shall be
          reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional
          officials, and the department or agency head.

          Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this
          policy which involve more than one institution. In the conduct of
          cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for
          safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for
          complying with this policy. With the approval of the department or
          agency head, an institution participating in a cooperative project may
          enter into a joint review arrangement, rely upon the review of another
          qualified IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication
          of effort.

        <P>
          Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, no investigator may
          involve a human being as a subject in research covered by this policy
          unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed
          consent of the subject or the subject&apos;s legally authorized
          representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under
          circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the
          representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to
          participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue
          influence. The information that is given to the subject or the
          representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or
          the representative. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may
          include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the
          representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the
          subject&apos;s legal rights, or releases or appears to release the
          investigator, the sponsor, the institution or its agents from
          liability for negligence.

        <P>
          Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or
          contracts are submitted to departments or agencies with the knowledge
          that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but
          definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or
          proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants
          when selection of specific projects is the institution&apos;s
          responsibility; research training grants in which the activities
          involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human
          subjects&apos; involvement will depend upon completion of instruments,
          prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. These applications
          need not be reviewed by an IRB before an award may be made. However,
