             This rule prescribes procedures by which NRCS is to implement the
            provisions of NEPA. The Natural Resources Conservation Service
            recognizes NEPA as the national charter for protection, restoration,
            and enhancement of the human environment. NEPA establishes policy,
            sets goals (
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              Section 101
            </aref>
            ), and provides means (

              Section 102

            . CEQ regulations that need no additional elaboration to address
            NRCS-assisted actions are not repeated in this rule, although the
            regulations are cited as references. The procedures include some
            overlap with CEQ regulations. This is done to highlight items of
            importance for NRCS. This does not supersede the existing body of
            NEPA regulations.

             Procedures for implementing NEPA are designed to ensure that
            environmental consequences are considered in decisionmaking. They
            allow NRCS to assist individuals and nonfederal public entities to
            take actions that protect, enhance, and restore environmental
            quality.

          <text>
             The environmental evaluation (EE) (formerly referred to by NRCS as
            an environmental assessment) is the part of planning that
            inventories and estimates the potential effects on the human
            environment of alternative solutions to resource problems. A wide
            range of environmental data together with social and economic
            information is considered in determining whether a proposed action
            is a major Federal action significantly affecting the human
            environment. The environmental evaluation for a program, regulation,
            or individual action is used to determine the need for an
            environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. It
            also aids in the consideration of alternatives and in the
            identification of available resources.

             NRCS uses an interdisciplinary environmental evaluation and
            planning approach in which specialists and groups having different
            technical expertise act as a team to jointly evaluate existing and
            future environmental quality. The interdisciplinary group considers
            structure and function of natural resource systems, complexity of
            problems, and the economic, social, and environmental effects of
            alternative actions. Public participation is an essential part of
            effective interdisciplinary planning. Even if an NRCS employee
            provides direct assistance to an individual land user, the basic
            data used is a result of interdisciplinary development of guide and
            planning criteria.

             Nonproject actions consist of technical and/or financial assistance
            provided to an individual, group, or local unit of government by
            NRCS primarily through a cooperative agreement with a local
            conservation district, such as land treatment recommended in the
            Conservation Operations, Great Plains Conservation, Rural Abandoned
            Mine, and Rural Clean Water Programs. These actions may include
            consultations, advice, engineering, and other technical 
            <PRTPAGE P='562' />
            assistance that land users usually cannot accomplish by themselves.
            Nonproject technical and/or financial assistance may result in the
            land user installing field terraces, waterways, field leveling,
            onfarm drainage systems, farm ponds, pasture management,
            conservation tillage, critical area stablization and other
            conservation practices.

            Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For
            instance, for a site-specific action, significance usually depends
            on the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole.

             When any new action is planned under the programs identified in
            paragraph (a) of this section, the EE performed by the RFO is to

            individual or cumulative impacts. Actions that have potential for
            significant impacts on the human environment are not categorically

             Increasing the freeboard (which is the height from the auxiliary

            dam or dike, originally built to NRCS standards, by raising the top
            elevation in order to meet current safety and performance standards.
            The purpose of the safety standard and associated work is to ensure
            that during extreme rainfall events, flows are confined to the
            auxiliary/emergency spillway so that the existing structure is not
            overtopped which may result in a catastrophic failure. Elevating the
            top of the dam will not result in an increase to lake or stream
            levels. Work will be confined to the existing dam and abutment
            areas, and no major change in reservoir operations will result.
            Examples of work may include the addition of fill material such as
            earth or gravel or placement of parapet walls;

             NRCS is to use scoping to identify and categorize significant
            environmental issues in its environmental evaluation. Formalized
            scoping is used to insure that an analytical EIS can be prepared
            that will reduce paperwork and avoid delay. Scoping allows NRCS to
            obtain the assistance and consultation of affected agencies that
            have special expertise or legal jurisdiction in the proposed action.
            If early environmental evaluation identifies a need for an EIS, NRCS
            is to publish a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS. The NOI is
            to request the assistance of all interested agencies, groups, and
            persons in determining the scope of the evaluation of the proposed
            action.

             To reduce duplication, NRCS may combine environmental documents
            with other planning documents of the same proposal, as appropriate.
            For example, NRCS, in consultation with CEQ and the office of the
            Secretary of Agriculture, has determined that each EIS is to satisfy
            the requirements for a regulatory impact analysis as required 
            <PRTPAGE P='571' />
            by Executive Order 12044. This may necessitate modifying the
            recommended CEQ format. If documents are combined, the RFO is to
            include the information and sections required by the CEQ regulations
            (
            <aref type='CFR'>
              40 CFR 
              <subref title='40' part='1502' sect='10' psec='' tq='N'>

              </subref>
            </aref>
            ). The environmental impact statement should indicate those
            considerations, including factors not related to environmental
            quality, that are likely to be relevant to a decision.

             The RFO is to establish the format and content of each document
            giving full consideration to the guidance and requirements of the
            CEQ regulations. The NRCS technical service center director is to
            provide guidance and concurrence on the format and content if the
            NRCS state conservationist is the RFO. The results of scoping are to
            determine the content of the EA or the EIS and the amount of detail
            needed to analyze the impacts.

             NRCS administers programs that may have a significant effect on the
            human environment. Program procedures incorporate provisions for
            compliance with NEPA and for providing environmental information to
            the public, other agencies, and decision makers in a timely manner.
            NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for projects under
            the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention and the Resource
            Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) programs. These usually
            require the preparation of project EA&apos;s or EIS&apos;s. The
            major decisionmaking points and their relation to NEPA compliance
            are as follows:

            final EIS, making adjustments where necessary by taking into
            consideration and responding to significant comments and opposing
            viewpoints received on the draft EIS. The following steps are to be

             EIS&apos;s received by the NRCS national office are screeened by
            the Director, Environmental Services Division to determine which
            office within NRCS will prepare comments. If the proposed action is
            within one State, the draft EIS will be forwarded to the appropriate
            STC and he will reply directly to the agency requesting the
            comments. If the proposed action involves more than one State, one
            STC will be designated to forward NRCS comments directly to the
            agency requesting the comments. In some cases, the action may be
            national or regional in scope, and require inputs from several
            offices within NRCS. In this instance, comments will be assembled in
            the Environmental Services Division for preparation of a response to
            the agency requesting comments. A copy of each response prepared by
            a STC should be sent to the Director, Environmental Services
            Division.

             A variety of plant and animal species of the United States are so
            reduced in numbers that they are threatened with extinction. The
            disappearance of any of these would be a biological, cultural, and
            in some instances an economic loss. Their existence contributes to
            scientific knowledge and understanding, and their presence adds
            interest and variety to life.

             The principal hazard to threatened and endangered species is the
            destruction or deterioration of their habitats by human activities
            such as industrialization, urbanization, agriculture, lumbering,
            recreation, and transportation. These activities of man will
            continue but the necessity of recognizing their adverse impacts and
            selecting alternatives that minimize or eliminate such impacts on
            threatened and endangered species is imperative.

            employees headquartered in almost every county, NRCS is uniquely
            capable of playing a vital role. Additional training will be
            provided as needed to meet NRCS responsibilities. NRCS will assist
            in the conservation of threatened and endangered species and
            consistent with legal requirements avoid or prevent activities
            detrimental to such species. NRCS concern for these species will not

             Natural areas are defined as land or water units where natural
            conditions are maintained insofar as possible. Natural conditions
            usually result from allowing ordinary physical and biological
            processes to operate with a minimum of human intervention.
            Manipulations may be required on natural areas to maintain or
            restore features that the areas were established to protect.

             Natural areas may be designated areas of Federal, non-Federal
            government, or privately controlled land. Designation may be formal
            as provided for under federal regulations for areas of federal land
            to be administered as natural areas or by foundations or
            conservation organizations specifically created to acquire and
            maintain natural areas. Designation may be informal in the case of
            private landowners who designate a specific area as a natural area
            and manage it accordingly. Several professional societies concerned
            with renewable natural resources encourage establishment of natural
            areas withdrawn from economic uses and recognition of natural areas
            maintained and managed in economic enterprises.

             Contributions to scenic beauty are a normal product of NRCS work.
            Strip-cropping, field borders, field windbreaks, and ponds are
            examples. Emphasis is given to those soil and water conservation
            measures that contribute to a productive and efficient agriculture
            and increase the attractiveness of rural America and are in line
            with goals and objectives of conservation districts. This is best
            accomplished by considering the landscape visual resource when
            providing planning assistance to individual landowners, groups,
            units of government, and watershed and resource conservation
            development project sponsors. NRCS responsibilities in recreation
            also offer opportunities to develop the scenic beauty of the rural
            landscape. Department of Agriculture Secretary&apos;s Memorandum
            1695, May 28, 1970, “Protecting and Improving The Quality of the
            Environment,” includes scenic beauty as an objective of the
            Department&apos;s programs.

          Through proper planning, flood plains can be managed to reduce the
          threat to human life, health, and property in ways that are
          environmentally sensitive. Most flood plains are valuable for
          maintaining agricultural and forest products for food and fiber, fish
          and wildlife habitat, temporary floodwater storage, park and
          recreation areas, and for maintaining and improving environmental
          values. NRCS technical and financial assistance is provided to land
          users primarily on non-Federal land through local conservation
          districts and other State and local agencies. Through its programs,
          NRCS encourages sound flood-plain management decisions by land users.

            conserve, preserve, and restore existing natural and beneficial
            values in base (100-year) flood plains as part of technical and
            financial assistance in the programs it administers. In addition,
            500-year flood plains are taken into account where there are
            “critical actions” such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes,
            utilities, and facilities producing or storing volatile, toxic, or

             The NRCS Administrator has determined that NRCS may not provide
            technical and financial assistance to land users if the results of
            such assisted actions are likely to have significant adverse effects
            on existing natural and beneficial values in the base flood plain
            and if NRCS determines that there are practicable alternatives
            outside the base flood plain. NRCS will make a case-by-case decision
            on whether to limit assistance whenever a land user proposes
            converting existing agricultural land to a significantly more
            intensive agricultural use that could have significant adverse
            effects on the natural and beneficial values or increase flood risk

            informs the land user how alternative land use decisions may affect
            the aquatic and terrestial ecosystems, human safety, property, and
            public welfare. Alternatives to flood-plain occupancy, modification,
            and development are discussed onsite with the land user by NRCS.
