             The determination of when an award is expended should be based on
            when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the
            activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to
            comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or
            grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions
            associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative
            agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds
            passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan
            and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of
            surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the
            distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of
            amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy;
            and, the period when insurance is in force.

            not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and

             In most cases, the auditee&apos;s compliance responsibility for
            vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment
            for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the
            provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance
            requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the
            auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor
            transactions which are structured such that the vendor is
            responsible for program compliance or the vendor&apos;s records must
            be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor
            transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall
            include determining whether these transactions are in compliance
            with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant
            agreements.

             A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular
            Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal
            agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow
            for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior
            to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after
            consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such
            request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would
            otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit
            approach described in

            shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the
            program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited
            as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the
            Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the
            auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A
            pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a
            subrecipient.

             In many cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to
            provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal
            control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and
            audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office
            of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such
            a guide is available. When a current program-specific audit guide is
            available, the auditor shall follow GAGAS and the guide when
            performing a program-specific audit.

            which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan

             Recipients expending more than $50 million in a year in Federal
            awards shall have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated
            cognizant agency for audit shall be the Federal awarding agency that
            provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient
            unless OMB makes a specific cognizant agency for audit assignment.
            The determination of the predominant amount of direct funding shall
            be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the recipient&apos;s
            fiscal years ending in 2004, 2009, 2014, and every fifth year
            thereafter. For example, audit cognizance for periods ending in 2006
            through 2010 will be determined based on Federal awards expended in
            2004. (However, for 2001 through 2005, the cognizant agency for
            audit is determined based on the predominant amount of direct
            Federal awards expended in the recipient&apos;s fiscal year ending
            in 2000.) Notwithstanding the manner in which audit cognizance is
            determined, a Federal awarding agency with cognizance for an auditee
            may reassign cognizance to another Federal awarding agency which
            provides substantial direct funding and agrees to be the cognizant
            agency for audit. Within 30 days after any reassignment, both the
            old and the new cognizant agency for audit shall notify the auditee,
            and, if known, the auditor of the reassignment. The cognizant agency
            for audit shall:

            are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the

            under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B), the

             There were no deficiencies in internal control which were
            identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.
            However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that
            any identified material weaknesses do not affect the management of
            Federal awards and provide a waiver.

             None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the
            following in either of the preceding two years (or, in the case of
            biennial audits, preceding two audit periods) in which they were
            classified as Type A programs:
