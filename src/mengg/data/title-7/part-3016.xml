            agency&apos;s payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on
            the grantee&apos;s or subgrantee&apos;s actual rate of disbursement.

             If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments
            described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency
            has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the
            grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may
            provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this
            procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to
            cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period
            generally geared to the grantee&apos;s disbursing cycle. Thereafter,
            the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash
            disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall
            not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such
            method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide
            timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee&apos;s
            actual cash disbursements.

            the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost

            grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the
            Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval
            may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the
            land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of
            the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the
            non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost-sharing or

            are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they
            are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are

             Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs.
            Program income includes income from fees for services performed,
            from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with
            grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under
            a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on
            loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in
            regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include
            interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc.
            and interest earned on any of them.

            date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the
            final financial report.

             A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in
            writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such
            request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A
            grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is
            inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal
            grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee
            would result in a change to the grantee&apos;s approved project
            which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the
            Federal agency&apos;s approval before approving the
            subgrantee&apos;s request.

            However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is

            replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds

             Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering
            clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to
            offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value
            engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract
            item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at
            the overall lower cost.

             Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in
            connection with every procurement action including contract
            modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the
            facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a
            starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before
            receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when
            the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated
            cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural
            engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary
            when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source
            procurements, including contract modifications or change orders,
            unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a
            catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial
            quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or
            regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to
            determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.

             Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the
            awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements
            where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure
            that the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for
            purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time
            the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document.
            However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review
            accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding
            agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually
            limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

             For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified

            agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and

             Grantees must submit the report no later than 15 working days
            following the end of each quarter. However, where an advance either
            by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is authorized at
            an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal
            agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working days
            following the end of each month.

             To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make
            special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any
            records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding
            agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it
            determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When
            the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency,
            the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or
            subgrantee.

             When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other

            period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the
            awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that
            period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly,
            the retention period for each year&apos;s records starts on the day
            the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of
            the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period
            starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report.
            If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period
            starts on the day the report would have been due.
