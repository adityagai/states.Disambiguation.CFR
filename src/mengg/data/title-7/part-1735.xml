             In making a preliminary assessment and a credit decision, the RUS
            will take into consideration the extent to which the emergency
            communications capability or emergency communications benefits
            already exist in the affected area and the need expressed by the
            proposed user of the emergency communications technology.

             The RUS will not consider an application to finance an upgrade of
            911 capabilities or other emergency communications capability by
            different providers serving the same geographic area to be
            automatically duplicative. For example, RUS will generally not
            consider an application from two competing wireless carriers to
            upgrade their E911 capabilities in overlapping geographic
            territories to be duplicative, however the carrier&apos;s
            competitive situation will be a relevant consideration in evaluating
            the ability of a service provider to repay their loan.

             Duplication considerations will be reviewed on the basis of the
            emergency communications benefit; the Agency encourages applicants
            to fully embrace interoperability to maximize the impact of RUS
            financed investments. In the case of dual or multi-use technologies,
            the extent to which the proposed non-emergency communications
            benefits are available from other providers within the proposed
            service area will be considered in determining loan feasibility.

             When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in order
            to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, loans may be
            made for the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and
            operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard
            to their geographical location.

             To the greatest extent practical, loans are limited to providing
            telephone facilities that serve subscribers in rural areas. In order
            to furnish and improve service to rural subscribers it may at times
            be necessary to provide loan funds to finance telephone facilities
            which (1) will also serve nonrural subscribers, or (2) are located
            in nonrural areas. Loans may be approved to finance such facilities
            if the Administrator determines, on a case-by-case basis, that (i)
            the primary purpose of the loan is to provide service to rural areas
            and (ii) the financing of facilities for nonrural subscribers is
            necessary and incidental to furnishing or improving telephone
            service in rural areas.

            serve nonrural subscribers is necessary and incidental to the
            principal purpose of the loan. The following are examples of
            purposes for which such loans may be made (such loans are not

            well as the rural portions of the telephone service area are
            included in the proposed system, the loan may include funds for both
            portions.

             Where the acquisition of an existing system located in and serving
            a nonrural area is necessary to serve as the nucleus of an expanded
            system to furnish area coverage service in rural areas, the loan may

             In order to fairly and equitably approve hardship loans to ensure

            will prioritize for approval all applications qualifying for

            determined to qualify for hardship financing. Subject to the
            availability of funds, applications receiving the highest number of
            points will be selected for loan approval each fiscal year quarter
            (the application with the most points will be approved first, the
            second highest next, etc.) The following ranking methodology and

             Loan guarantees under this section will be considered for only
            those borrowers specifically requesting a guarantee. Borrowers may
            also specify that the loan to be guaranteed shall be made by the
            Federal Financing Bank (FFB). RUS provides loan guarantees pursuant
            to

            hardship loans or concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans. No
            fees or charges are assessed for any guarantee of a loan provided by
            RUS. In view of the Government&apos;s guarantee, RUS generally
            obtains a first lien on all assets of the borrower (see

        <P>
          After June 10, 1991, and prior to November 1, 1993, RUS made certain
          variable rate loans at interest rates less than 5 percent but not less
          than 2 percent. For those borrowers that received variable rate loans,
          this section describes the method by which interest rates are
          adjusted. The interest rate used in determining feasibility is the
          rate charged to the borrower until the end of the Forecast Period for
          that loan. At the end of the Forecast Period, the interest rate for
          the loan may be annually adjusted by the Administrator upward to a
          rate not greater than 5 percent, or downward to a rate not less than
          the rate determined in the feasibility study on which the loan was
          based, based on the borrower&apos;s ability to pay debt service and
          maintain a minimum TIER of 1.0. Downward and upward adjustments will
          be rounded down to the nearest one-half or whole percent. To make this
          adjustment, projections set forth in the loan feasibility study will
          be revised annually by RUS (beginning within four months after the end
          of the Forecast Period) to reflect updated revenue and expense factors
          based on the borrower&apos;s current operating condition. Any such
          adjustment will be effective on July 1 of the year in which the
          adjustment 
          <PRTPAGE P='319' />
          was determined. If the Administrator determines that the borrower is
          capable of meeting the minimum TIER requirements of

          of 5 percent.

             Except as described in this paragraph (a), RUS loans approved after
            October 6, 1997 must be repaid with interest within a period that,
            rounded to the nearest whole year, equals the expected composite
            economic life of the facilities to be financed, as calculated by
            RUS; expected composite economic life means the depreciated life
            plus three years. The expected composite economic life shall be
            based on the depreciation rates for the facilities financed by the
            loan. In states where the borrower must obtain state regulatory
            commission approval of depreciation rates, the depreciation rates
            used shall be the rates currently approved by the state commission
            or rates for which the borrower has received state commission
            approval. In cases where a state regulatory commission does not
            approve depreciation rates, the expected composite economic life
            shall be based on the most recent median depreciation rates
            published by RUS for all borrowers (see 
            <aref type='CFR'>
              7 CFR

            ). Borrowers may request a repayment period that is longer or
            shorter than the expected composite economic life of the facilities
            financed. If the Administrator determines that a repayment period
            based on the expected composite economic life of the facilities
            financed is likely to cause the borrower to experience hardship, the
            Administrator may agree to approve a period longer than requested. A
            shorter period may be approved as long as the Administrator
            determines that the loan remains feasible.

            by the original feasibility study prepared in connection with the

            interest on the refunding notes, would remain unchanged. Disposition
            of funds in the funded reserve will be determined by RUS at the

            period, interest and principal payments on all funds advanced during

             Loans are to be repaid according to their terms. RUS generally
            obtains a first lien on all assets of the borrower. This lien shall
            be in the form of a mortgage by the borrower to the Government or a
            deed of trust made by and between the borrower and a trustee,
            satisfactory to the Administrator, together with such security
            agreements, financing statements, or other security documents as RUS
            may deem necessary in a particular case. Where a borrower is unable
            by reason of pre-existing encumbrances, or otherwise, to furnish a
            first mortgage lien on its entire system the Administrator may, if 
            <PRTPAGE P='321' />
            he determines such security to be reasonably adequate and the form
            and nature thereof otherwise appropriate, accept other forms of
            security. See RUS Bulletins 320-4, 320-22, 321-2, 322-2, 323-1, and
            326-1 for details. See

            in rural areas.

            outstanding RUS loan and all outstanding balances of the previous
            RUS loans are paid in full.

             In determining the amount it will lend for each acquisition, RUS
            shall place a valuation on all telephone facilities that are to be
            acquired with loan funds. RUS may consider fair market value, the
            original cost less depreciation of the facilities, income generating
            potential, any improvement in the financial strength of the borrower
            as a result of the acquisition, and any other factors deemed
            relevant by RUS to determine the reasonableness of the acquisition
            price and the amount of loan funds RUS will provide for an
            acquisition. RUS shall not consider the acquisition price reasonable
            or approve a loan if, in the Administrator&apos;s opinion, the
            acquisition price will endanger financial feasibility. If the
            acquisition price exceeds the amount RUS will lend, the borrower
            provides the remainder.

            Office as soon as possible. The borrower must either obtain RUS

            make the commitments subject to RUS&apos;s approval. Failure to
            comply with these requirements will disqualify the borrower from
            obtaining an RUS loan for the acquisition unless the Administrator
            determines there were extenuating circumstances.

          Loan funds may be approved for the acquisition and improvement of
          facilities to serve nonrural subscribers only if the principal purpose
          of the loan is to furnish and improve rural service and only if the
          use of loan funds to serve nonrural subscribers is necessary and
          incidental to the principal purpose of the loan. For example, when the
          acquisition of an existing system located in and serving a nonrural
          area is necessary to serve as the nucleus of an expanded system to
          furnish area coverage service in rural areas, the loan may include

        <P>
          An acquisition of toll line facilities financed with loan funds must
          be necessary and incidental, as determined by the Administrator, to
          furnishing or improving telephone service in rural areas. The borrower
          shall submit to RUS the acquisition agreement, the original cost less
          depreciation of the facilities, any concurrences with the connecting
          companies involved, and a detailed inventory of the facilities to be
          purchased. The borrower must submit to RUS evidence, satisfactory to
          the Administrator, of the borrower&apos;s ownership of the toll line
          facilities before loan funds for improvement of those facilities will
          be advanced.

          When an acquisition is limited to toll line facilities and loan funds
          are not involved, RUS approval of the acquisition is not required. The
          borrower, however, shall submit to RUS for its approval all
          concurrences with the connecting companies involved and any other
          proof of ownership of the toll facilities required by RUS.
