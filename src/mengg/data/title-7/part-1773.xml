             The CPA must belong to and participate in a peer review program,
            and must have undergone a satisfactory peer review of the accounting
            and audit practice conducted by an approved peer review program
            under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, unless a waiver is granted
            under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The reviewing organization
            must not be affiliated with or have had its most recent peer review
            conducted by the organization currently being reviewed (reciprocal
            reviews). After the initial peer review has been performed, the CPA
            must undergo a peer review of the accounting and audit practice
            within 36 months of the issuance of the previous peer review or at
            such additional times as designated by the peer review executive
            committee.

             During the planning stages of a financial statement audit, GAGAS
            and AICPA standards require the auditor to communicate certain
            information regarding the nature and extent of testing and reporting
            on compliance with laws and regulations and internal control over
            financial reporting. The communication must include the nature of
            any additional testing of compliance and internal control required
            by laws and regulations or otherwise requested, and whether the
            auditors are planning to provide opinions on compliance with laws
            and regulations and internal control over financial reporting. This
            communication must take the form of an audit engagement letter
            prepared by the CPA and formally accepted by the board of directors
            or an audit committee representing the board of directors. The
            engagement letter must also encompass those items prescribed in SAS
            83, entitled “Establishing an Understanding with the Client”. It
            must also include the following:

             In accordance with GAGAS, the auditor must design the audit to
            provide reasonable assurance of detecting fraud that is material to
            the financial statements and material misstatements resulting from
            direct and material illegal acts, and noncompliance with the

            contracts or grant agreements that could have a material indirect
