            review the geographic distribution of United States production of
            Christmas trees and the quantity and source of Christmas tree
            imports. The review will be conducted through State crop production
            figures and Board assessment records, including the amount of
            assessments collected from importers, or other government data. If
            warranted, the Board will recommend to the Secretary that membership
            on the Board be altered to reflect any changes in geographic
            distribution of domestic Christmas tree production and the quantity
            of imports.

             that there shall be at least one importer member on the Board. Such
            adjustments shall not increase the total number of Board members.
            The adjustments to the Board membership would be submitted to the
            Secretary by Board recommendation and be implemented by the
            Secretary through rulemaking.

             Nomination of producer members will be conducted by the Board. The
            Board staff will seek nominations for each vacant producer seat from
            each region from producers who have paid their assessments to the
            Board in the most recent fiscal period. Producers who produce
            Christmas trees in more than one region may seek nomination only in
            the region in which they produce the majority of their Christmas
            trees. For selection to the initial Board, the Secretary will notify
            producers to request nominations to the Board. Subsequent
            nominations will be submitted to the Board office and placed on a
            ballot that will be sent to producers in each region for a vote.
            Producers who produce Christmas trees in more than one region may
            only vote in the region in which they produce the majority of their
            Christmas trees. The nominee receiving the highest number of votes
            and the nominee receiving the second highest number of votes shall
            be submitted to the Department as the producers&apos; first and
            second choice nominees. The Board shall submit nominations to the
            Secretary not less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the term
            of office.

          Board members will serve for a term of three years and be able to
          serve a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms. When the Board is
          first established, the members will be assigned initial terms of two,
          three, and four years. Initial terms will be staggered to assure
          continuity of the Board. The term of office will begin on January 1
          and conclude on December 31. Members serving the initial term of two
          and four years will be eligible to serve a second term of three-years.
          Thereafter, each of the positions will carry a full three-year term.
          Board members shall serve during the term of office for which they
          have been appointed and qualified, and until their successors are
          appointed and have qualified.

             Such assessments shall be levied at an initial rate of 15 cents per
            Christmas tree domestically produced or imported into the United
            States. The assessment rate will be reviewed by the Board, after the
            initial referendum is conducted pursuant to this subpart. The
            assessment rate may be increased or decreased no more than 2 cents
            per Christmas tree during the fiscal period. Any change in the
            assessment rate shall be subject to rulemaking by the Department.
            The assessment rate shall not exceed 20 cents per Christmas tree,
            nor shall it be less than 10 cents per Christmas tree, unless a
            majority of producers and importers approve such other levels of
            assessment through a referendum conducted pursuant to this subpart.

            to the Board and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent
            of organic Christmas trees, on a form provided by the Board, at any
            time initially and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of

            section. If the importer complies with the requirements of this
            section, the Board will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate

            a 9-digit alphanumeric number of the United States classification

            trees bearing this alphanumeric number assigned by the Board will
            not be subject to assessments.
