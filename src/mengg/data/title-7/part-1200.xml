             An order may be proposed by any organization certified pursuant to
            the Act or any interested person affected by the Act, including the
            Secretary. Any person or organization other than the Secretary
            proposing an order shall file with the Administrator a written
            application, together with a copy of the proposal, requesting the
            Secretary to hold a hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such
            proposal, the Administrator shall cause such investigation to be
            made and such consideration to be given as, in the
            Administrator&apos;s opinion, are warranted. If the investigation
            and consideration lead the Administrator to conclude that the
            proposed order will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of
            the Act, or that for other proper reasons a hearing should not be
            held on the proposal, the Administrator shall deny the application,
            and promptly notify the applicant of such denial, which notice shall
            be accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds for the denial.

            an order, the Administrator shall sign and cause to be served a
            notice of hearing, as provided herein.

            judge finds that a person, acting as counsel or representative for
            any person participating in the proceeding, is guilty of unethical
            or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such person be
            precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such
            proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such
            order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending
            disposition of the appeal: Except that the judge may suspend the
            proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the
            client to obtain other counsel or representative.

          The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing as
          soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written
          arguments, briefs, proposed findings, and proposed conclusions and
          shall furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be
          necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall
          transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the
          transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the
          exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. The
          judge shall attach to the original transcript of the testimony a
          certificate stating that, to the best of the judge&apos;s knowledge
          and belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given
          at the hearing, except in such particulars as the judge shall specify,
          and that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced
          at the hearing with such exceptions as the judge shall specify. A copy
          of such certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the
          transcript of testimony. In accordance with such certificate the
          hearing clerk shall note upon the official record copy, and cause to
          be noted on other copies of the transcript, each correction detailed
          therein by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the text as
          originally transcribed) at the appropriate place any words necessary
          to make the same conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the
          judge. The hearing clerk shall obtain and file certifications to the
          effect that such corrections have been effectuated in copies other
          than the official record copy.

             If the Administrator is of the opinion that the petition, or any
            portion thereof, does not substantially comply, in form or content,
            with the Act or with requirements of paragraph (b) of this section,
            the Administrator may, within 30 days after the service of the
            petition, file with the hearing clerk a motion to dismiss the
            petition, or any portion of the petition, on one or more of the
            grounds stated in this paragraph. Such motion shall specify the
            grounds for objection to the petition and if based, in whole or in
            part, on allegations of fact not appearing on the face of the
            petition, shall be accompanied by appropriate affidavits or
            documentary evidence substantiating such allegations of fact. The
            motion may be accompanied by a memorandum of law. Upon receipt of
            such motion, the hearing clerk shall cause a copy thereof to be
            served upon the petitioner, together with a notice stating that all
            papers to be submitted in opposition to such motion, including any
            memorandum of law, must be filed by the petitioner with the hearing
            clerk not later than 20 days after the service of such notice upon
            the petitioner. Upon the expiration of the time specified in such
            notice, or upon receipt of such papers from the petitioner, the
            hearing clerk shall transmit all papers which have been filed in
            connection with the motion to the judge for the judge&apos;s
            consideration.
