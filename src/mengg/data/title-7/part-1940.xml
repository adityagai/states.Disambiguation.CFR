             This subpart is designed to integrate the requirements of NEPA with
            other planning and environmental review procedures required by law,
            or by Agency practice, so that all such procedures run concurrently
            rather than consecutively. The environmental document, which results
            from the implementation of this subpart, provides on a project basis
            a single reference point for the Agency&apos;s compliance and/or
            implementation of the following requirements and policies:

             The primary objectives of this subpart are for the Agency to make
            better decisions by taking into account potential environmental
            impacts of proposed projects and by working with FmHA or its
            successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

             applicants, other Federal agencies, Indian tribes, State and local
            governments, and interested citizens and organizations in order to
            formulate actions that advance the program goals in a manner that
            will protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality. To
            accomplish these objectives, the identification of potentially
            significant impacts on the human environment is mandated to occur
            early in the Agency&apos;s planning and decisionmaking processes.
            Important decision points are identified. The completion of the
            environmental review process is coordinated with these decision
            points, and this review must be completed prior to the Agency&apos;s
            first major decision on whether or not to participate in the
            proposal. This early availability of the results of the
            environmental review process is intended to ensure that Agency
            decisions are based on an understanding of their environmental
            consequence, as well as the consequences of alternative courses of
            action.

             A one-percent chance flood or based flood—A flood of a magnitude
            that occurs once every 100 years on the average. Within any one-year
            period there is one chance in 100 of the occurrence of such a flood.
            Most importantly, however, the cumulative risk of flooding increases
            with time. Statistically, there is about one chance in five that a
            flood of this magnitude will occur within a 20-year period, the
            length of time commonly defined as the useful life of a facility.
            Over a 30-year period, the life of a typical mortgage, the
            probability of such a flood occurring increases to greater than one
            chance in four.

             Those reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts that result from
            the additional public facility, residential, commercial, or
            industrial development or growth that a federally financed project
            may cause, induce or accommodate. Consequently, indirect impacts
            often occur later in time than the construction of the Federal
            project and can be removed in distance from the construction site.
            For example, a water transmission line may be designed to serve
            additional residential development. The environmental impacts of
            that residential development represent an indirect impact of the
            federally funded water line. Those indirect impacts which deserve
            the greatest consideration include changes in the patterns of land
            use, population density or growth rate, and the corresponding
            changes to air and water quality and other natural systems.

             An alternative that is capable of attainment within the confines of
            relevant constraints. The test of practicability, therefore, depends

            constraints imposed by environmental, economic, legal, social and
            technological parameters. This test, however, is not limited by the
            temporary unavailability of sufficient financial resources to
            implement an alternative. That is, alternatives cannot be rejected

            alternatives that must be analyzed to determine if a practicable

            assisting rural areas, composed of farms and rural towns, goes
            hand-in-hand with protecting the environmental resources upon which
            these systems are dependent. Basic resources necessary to both farm
            and rural settlements include important farmlands and forestlands,
            prime rangelands, wetlands, and floodplains. The definitions of
            these areas are contained in the appendix to Departmental Regulation
            9500-3, Land Use Policy, which is included as exhibit A of this
            subpart. For assistance in locating and defining floodplains and
            wetlands, the locations and telephone numbers of the Federal
            Emergency Management Administration&apos;s regional offices have
            been included as exhibit J of this subpart, and similar information

             It is also recognized that unless carefully reviewed, some
            proposals designed to serve the needs of rural communities can
            adversely affect the existing economic base and settlement patterns
            of the community, as well as create development pressures on land
            and environmental resources essential to farm economies. An example
            of such a proposal might be the extension of utilities and other
            types of infrastructure beyond a community&apos;s existing
            settlement pattern and into important farmlands for the purpose of
            commercial or residential expansion, even though there is available
            space within the existing settlement pattern for such expansion. Not
            only may the loss of important farmlands unnecessarily result, but
            the community may be faced with the economic costs of providing
            public services to outlying areas, as well as the deterioration of
            its central business or commercial area; the latter may not be able
            to compete with the newer, outlying commercial establishments. These
            results are undesirable, and to avoid their occurrence, projects
            designed to meet rural community needs (

            cannot be limited in service area to these areas contiguous with

            in noncontiguous areas. Any additional capacity within the system
            will be limited to meet reasonable growth needs, and, to the extent
            practicable, be designed to meet such needs within existing

             Each application for financial assistance or subdivision approval
            and the proposed disposal of real property will be reviewed to
            determine if it would impair a State water quality standard or meet
            antidegradation requirements. When necessary, the proposed activity
            will be modified to protect water quality standards, including
            designated and/or existing beneficial uses that water quality
            criteria are designed to protect, and meet antidegradation
            requirements.

            § 1940.310 of
          </aref>
           this subpart as categorical exclusions require the preparation of an
          environmental assessment in order to determine if the proposal will
          have a significant impact on the environment. For purposes of
          implementing NEPA, the actions listed in this section are presumed to
          be major Federal actions. If an action has a potential to create a
          significant environmental impact, an EIS must be prepared. (In
          situations when there is clearly a potential for a significant impact,
          the EIS may be initiated directly without the preparation of an
          assessment.) It is recognized that many of the applications funded
          annually by FmHA or its successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
            Public Law 103-354
          </aref>
           involve small-scale projects having limited environmental impacts.
          However, because on occasion they have the potential to create a
          significant impact, each must be assessed to determine the degree of
          impact. The scope and level of detail of an assessment for a
          small-scale action, though, need only be sufficient to determine
          whether the potential impacts are substantial and further analysis is
          necessary. Therefore, for the purpose of implementing NEPA, FmHA or
          its successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
            Public Law 103-354
          </aref>
           has classified its smaller scale approval actions as Class I actions.
          The format which will be used for accomplishing the environmental
          assessment of a Class I action is provided in Form FmHA or its
          successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
            Public Law 103-354
          </aref>
           1940-21. An important aspect of this classification method is that it
          allows FmHA or its successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

          Environmental assessments for Class II actions.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          Class II actions are basically those which exceed the thresholds
          established for Class I actions and, consequently, have the potential
          for resulting in more varied and substantial environmental impacts. A
          more detailed environmental assessment is, therefore, required for
          Class II actions in order to determine if the action requires an EIS.
          The format that will be used for completing this assessment is
          included as exhibit H of this subpart. Further guidance on Class II
          actions is contained in 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            § 1940.318 of
          </aref>

          actions and are defined as follows:

            assistance from the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). If not, the
            applicant will be requested to do so. Subsequently, an approved loan

             must make its environmental reviews simultaneously with other loan
            processing actions so that they are an integral part of the loan
            process. Whenever the potential for a major adverse environmental
            impact is recognized, such as issues pertaining to floodplains,
            wetlands, endangered species, or the need for an EIS, priority
            consideration will be given to resolving this issue by appropriate

            period, but loan processing actions will not be taken that might
            limit alternatives to be considered or whose outcome may be affected
            by the environmental review. The environmental impact review
            (whether a categorical exclusion, environmental assessment or EIS)
            must be completed prior to the issuance of the letter of conditions
            for Community Programs, prior to issuance of a conditional
            commitment for the Business and Industry and Farmer Program
            Guaranteed Loan Programs, and either prior to loan approval or
            obligation of funds, whichever occurs first, for all other programs
            where a preapplication is used. As an exception, however, whenever
            an application must be submitted to the National Office for

            will sign as the preparer. If the environmental review document is
            either a Class I or Class II assessment, it must be provided to the
            SEC for review prior to being submitted to the approval official for
            final determinations. The SEC will review the assessment and provide

            Director will also make the final decision whenever a State Office
            approving official disagrees with the joint recommendations of the
            preparer and the SEC. In either case, should the State Director
            desire, the matter will be forwarded to the National Office for
            resolution. The Program Support Staff will coordinate its resolution
            with the appropriate Assistant Administrator. Failure of these
            parties to resolve the matter will require a final decision by the
            Administrator. The State Director should also request the assistance
            of the National Office on actions that are too difficult to analyze

             The use of categorical exclusions exempts properly defined actions
            or proposals from the review requirements of NEPA. It does not
            exempt proposals from the requirements of other environmental laws,
            regulations or Executive orders. Each proposal 
            <PRTPAGE P='32' />
            must be reviewed to determine the applicability of other
            environmental requirements. Extraordinary circumstances may cause an

            the application to lose its categorical exclusion. An environmental
            assessment for a Class I action must then be initiated. This
            assessment serves the purposes of providing for the extraordinary

             Once adequate data has been obtained, the assessment will be
            initiated in the format and manner described in exhibit H of this
            subpart. In completing the assessment, appropriate experts from
            State and Federal agencies, universities, local and private groups
            will be contacted as necessary for their views. In so doing, the
            preparer should communicate with these agencies or parties in the
            most appropriate and expeditious manner possible, depending upon the
            seriousness of the potential impacts and the need for formal
            documentation. Appropriate experts must be contacted whenever
            required by a specific provision of this subpart or whenever the
            preparer does not have sufficient data or expertise available within
            FmHA or its successor agency under

            </aref>
             to adequately assess the degree of a potential impact or the need
            for avoidance or mitigation. Comments from an expert must be
            obtained in writing whenever required by a specific provision of
            this subpart or the potential environmental

            impact is either controversial, complex, major, or apparently major.
            When correspondence is exchanged, it will be appended to the
            assessment. Oral discussions should be documented in the manner
            indicated in exhibit H of this subpart. On the other hand, there is
            no need for the preparer to seek expert views outside of the Agency
            when there is no specific requirement to do so and the preparer has
            sufficient expertise available within FmHA or its successor agency

             At the earliest possible stage in the assessment process, the

             staff familiar with the project area should assist in this
            identification effort. If there is a potential for cumulative
            impacts, the preparer will consult with the involved agencies to
            determine the nature, timing and results of their environmental
            analysis. These consultations will be documented in the assessment
            and considered or adopted when making the environmental impact
            determination. (See

             Consultations similar to those discussed in paragraph (c) of this

            review and approval of a necessary plan or permit. For example, a
            construction permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may be
            required for a project. In such an instance, the environmental
            assessment cannot be completed until the preparer has either
            reviewed the other Agency&apos;s completed environmental analysis or
            consulted with the other Agency and is reasonably sure of the scope,
            content, and expected environmental impact determination of the

            the project will have a significant impact, a joint or lead impact

             For actions having a variety of complex or interrelated impacts
            that are difficult for the preparer to assess, consideration should
            be given to holding a public meeting in the manner described in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 1940.331(c) of
            </aref>
             this subpart. Such meetings should not be assumed as being limited
            to projects for which EISs are being prepared. Such a meeting can
            serve a useful purpose in better defining and identifying complex
            impacts, as well as locating expertise with respect to them. The
            results of a public meeting and the follow-up from it can also serve
            as a valuable tool in reaching an early understanding on the
            potential need for an EIS. When identified impacts are difficult to
            quantify (such as odor and visual and community impacts) or
            controversial, a public information meeting should be held near the
            project site and the local area&apos;s concern about it. Whenever
            held, it should be announced and organized in the manner described
            in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            . However, a transcript of the meeting need not be prepared, but the
            preparer will make detailed notes for incorporation in the
            assessment. (See

             Throughout this assessment process, the preparer will keep in mind
            the criteria for determining a significant environmental impact. If
            at any time in this process it is determined that a significant
            impact would result, the preparer will so notify the approving 
            <PRTPAGE P='36' />
            official. Those actions specified in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 1940.320 of
            </aref>
             this subpart will then be initiated, unless the approving official
            disagrees with the preparer&apos;s recommended determination, in
            which case further review of the determination may be required as
            explained in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 1940.316 (b), (d) and (e) of
            </aref>
             this subpart. As soon as possible after the need for an EIS is
            determined, the applicant will also be advised of this in writing,
            as well as reinformed of the limitations on its actions during the
            period that the EIS is being completed. (See

              § 1940.309(e) of
            </aref>
             this subpart.) The applicant&apos;s failure to comply with these
            limitations will be considered as grounds for postponement of
            further consideration of the application until such problem is
            alleviated.

             Similarly, throughout the assessment process, consideration will be
            given to incorporating mechanisms into the proposed action for
            reducing, mitigating, or avoiding adverse impacts. Examples of such
            mechanisms which are commonly referred to as mitigation measures
            include the deletion, relocation, redesign or other modifications of
            the project elements; the dedication of environmentally sensitive
            areas which would otherwise be adversely affected by the action or
            its indirect impacts; soil erosion and sedimentation plans to
            control runoff during land-disturbing activities; the establishment
            of vegetative buffer zones between project sites and adjacent land
            uses; protective measures recommended by environmental and
            conservation agencies, including but not limited to interstate,
            international, Federal, State, area-wide, and local agencies having
            jurisdiction or special expertise regarding the action&apos;s
            impacts; and zoning. Mitigation measures must be tailored to fit the
            specific needs of the action, and they must also be practical and
            enforceable. Mitigation measures which will be taken must be
            documented in the assessment (Item XIX of exhibit H of this
            subpart), and include an analysis of their environmental impacts and
            potential effectiveness and placed in the offer of financial
            assistance as special conditions or in the implementation
            requirements when the action does not involve financial assistance.
            These measures will be consistent with the basic goal of the
            proposed action and developed in consultation with the appropriate
            program office.

            minimal impacts and for documenting a finding of no significant
            impact, as well as compliance determinations for other applicable
            environmental laws, regulations and policies. The second major
            purpose is to serve as a screening tool for identifying those Class
            I actions which have more than minimal impacts and which, therefore,
            require a more detailed environmental review.

             An important element of this assessment is to determine if the
            action affects an environmental resource which is the subject of a
            special Federal consultation or coordination requirement. Such
            resources are listed in the assessment format, Form FmHA or its
            successor agency under

            properties, for example. If one of the listed resources is to be
            affected, the preparer must demonstrate the required compliance by
            accomplishing the review and coordination requirements for that
            resource. Documentation of the steps taken and coordination achieved
            will be attached. However, if more than one listed resource is to be
            affected, this will be viewed as the action having more than minimal
            impacts and the environmental assessment format for a Class II
            action will be initiated except if the action under review is an
            application for a Housing Preservation Grant.

            incorported into the assessment, if this review applies to the

            concerns that focus on a single impact, air quality, for example,
            the analysis of such complaints or questions can be handled under

            actions of other Federal agencies and related nonfederal actions
            must also be assessed on this basis. When there is a Federal action
            involved, the environmental review conducted by that Agency will be

             Whenever the District Director or County Supervisor determines
            there is a need to prepare an EIS, the State Director will be
            notified. The EIS will be prepared at the State Office and the State
            Director will assume the responsibility for preparing it. The State
            will in turn notify the Administrator of these EISs, as well as
            those needed EISs identified by a State Office review. EISs will be
            prepared according to this section. The State Director will be

            doing, the State Director will consult with the National Office to
            determine that the document meets the requirements of NEPA. State
            Directors will be responsible for issuing such EISs. However, unless

            capability and experience in preparing EISs, the State Director will
            not issue the EIS until reviewed and approved by the Administrator.

            as possible. To accomplish this, the below-listed parties need to be
            identified in advance; the list should be expanded as familiarity
            with the project increases. Those parties falling within the first
            four groups should be formally requested to serve as cooperating
            agencies. If any of these agencies appear to be a more appropriate
            lead agency than FmHA or its successor agency under

            developing a coordinated government approach to the preparation and
            review of the EIS.

             The first step in this process will be the publication of a notice
            of intent to prepare the EIS. The notice will indicate that an EIS
            will be prepared and will briefly describe the proposed action and
            possible alternatives; state the name, address, and phone number of
            the preparer, indicating that this person can answer questions about
            the proposed action and the EIS; list any cooperating agencies, and
            include the date and time of the scoping meeting. If the latter
            information is not known at the time the notice of intent is
            prepared, it will be incorporated into a special notice, when
            available, and published and distributed in the same manner as the
            notice of intent. It will be the responsibility of the preparer of
            the EIS to inform the National Office of the need to publish a
            notice of intent which will coordinate the publication of the notice
            in the

             The EIS will be prepared using an interdisciplinary approach that
            will ensure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences
            and the environmental design arts. The disciplines of the preparers
            will be appropriate to address the potential environmental impact
            associated with the project. This can be accomplished both in the
            information collection stage and the analysis stage by communication
            and coordination with environmental experts at local, State and
            Federal agencies (particularly cooperating agencies) and
            universities near the project site. When needed information or
            expertise is not readily available, these needs should be met
            through procurement contracts with qualified consulting firms.

          354 may consider the concept of tiering in the preparation of
          environmental assessments and EISs. Tiering refers to the coverage of
          general matters in broader environmental impact statements, such as
          one done for a national program or regulation, with subsequent
          narrower statements or environmental analyses incorporating by
          reference the broader matters and concentrating on the issues specific
          to the action under consideration. Tiering can be used when the
          sequence of analysis is from the program level to site-specific
          actions taken under that program or from an initial EIS to a
          supplement which discusses the issues requiring supplementation.

             Numerous States have enacted environmental policy acts or

            State requirements and to establish a working relationship with the
            State personnel responsible for their implementation.

             The applicant has complied with the State&apos;s NEPA, and it was

            project would not result in sufficient potential impacts to warrant
            the preparation of an impact statement or other detailed
            environmental report required by the State NEPA. This finding or

             The applicant has complied with the State NEPA, and it was
            determined under its implementing guidelines that a significant
            impact will result. This fact will be given great weight in the
            Agency&apos;s environmental determination. However, the State&apos;s
            definition of significant environmental impact may encompass a much
            lower threshold of impacts compared to FmHA or its successor agency
            under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
            &apos;s. In such a case, if the preparer does not believe that a
            significant impact will result under Agency guidelines for
            determining significant impacts, the environmental assessment will
            be prepared and include a detailed discussion with supporting
            information as to why the environmental reviewer&apos;s
            recommendation differs from that of the State&apos;s. However, the
            assessment cannot be completed until the State&apos;s impact
            statement requirements have been fulfilled by the applicant and the
            resulting impact statement has been reviewed by the preparer. An
            environmental impact determination will then be executed based upon
            the assessment and the statement.

             It should be emphasized that at no time does the completion of an
            impact statement under the requirements of a State NEPA obviate the
            requirement for FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

             to prepare an impact statement. Consequently, as soon as it is
            clear to the preparer that the Agency will have to prepare a
            statement, every attempt should be made to accomplish the statement
            simultaneously with the State&apos;s. Coordination with State
            personnel is necessary so that data and expertise can be shared. In
            this manner, duplication of effort and the review periods for the
            separate statements can be minimized. This process clearly requires
            a close working relationship with the appropriate State personnel.

             For projects that undergo the preparation of an environmental
            impact statement, the first element of formal public participation
            in the EIS process involves the publication of the notice of intent
            to prepare an EIS. The content of the notice of intent and its
            publication by FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

            the applicant will be requested to publish a copy of the notice of
            intent and the date of the scoping meeting in the newspaper of
            general circulation in the vicinity of the proposed action and in
            any local or community-oriented newspapers within the proposed

             The public notice procedures for actions that will affect
            floodplains, wetlands, important farmlands, prime rangelands or
            prime forest lands are contained in exhibit C of this subpart. These
            procedures apply to actions that require either an EIS, Class II
            assessment or Class I assessment. However, whenever an action
            normally classified as a categorical exclusion requires a Class I
            assessment because of the potential impact to one of these important
            land resources, no public notice procedures apply in the course of
            completing the Class I assessment. When applicable to an action, as
            specified in exhibit C of this subpart, these public notice
            procedures can apply at two distinct stages. The first stage, a
            preliminary notice, applies to any of the five important land
            resources. The second stage, a final notice, is followed by a
            fifteen-day public review period and applies only to actions that
            will impact floodplains or wetlands. For Class II actions, this
            final notice procedure must be combined with any applicable finding
            of no significant environmental impact, which is described in
            paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Individual copies of the
            preliminary and final notices will be sent to the same parties that
            are required to be sent a notice of finding of no significant
            impact, as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, with the
            following exception. Whenever property owners affected by proposed
            mitigation measures, such as proposed hook-up restrictions on
            portions of water or sewer lines that will traverse floodplains, are
            advised of these proposed measures in a preliminary notice, these
            property owners need not be sent copies of the final notice as long
            as the mitigation measures in the final notice are unchanged from
            the preliminary notice and no property 
            <PRTPAGE P='48' />
            owners raised objections or concerns over the mitigation measures.

            produced. The applicant will be requested to assist in obtaining a
            facility for holding the meeting. To the extent possible, this

             When an emergency circumstance makes it necessary to take an action
            with significant environmental impact without observing the
            provisions of this subpart or the CEQ regulations, the Administrator
            will consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements before the
            proposed action is taken. It must be recognized that CEQ&apos;s
            regulations limit such arrangements to actions necessary to control
            the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other actions remain subject
            to NEPA review. For purposes of this subpart, an emergency
            circumstance is defined as one involving an immediate or imminent
            danger to public health or safety.

            periods, the timing of the assessment process, and the content of
            environmental review documents. Alternative arrangements will be
            established on a case by case basis taking into account the nature
            of the emergency and the time reasonably available to respond to it.
            These alternative arrangements will, to the extent possible, attempt
            to achieve the substantive requirements of this subpart such as
            avoiding impacts to important land resources, when practicable, and
            minimizing potential adverse environmental impacts. In all cases,
            the environmental findings and determinations required for Class I
            and Class II assessments must be executed by the appropriate FmHA or

            (Refer to paragraph (a) of this section should the approval official
            for the action determine that an EIS is necessary.) Additionally,
            all applicable consultation and coordination procedures required by
            law or regulation will be initiated with the appropriate Federal or
            State agency(s). Such procedures will be accomplished in the most

             Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic state factor as a part
            of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas
            take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a
            particular program and through a normalization and weighting process
            for each of the criteria calculate the basic State Factor (SF). The
            data sources used for each criteria is believed to be the most
            current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the
            criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative
            value to the importance of each of the criteria.

            the basic criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The
            transition formula first checks whether the current year&apos;s
            basic formula allocation is within the transition range (+ or
            −percentage points of the proportional amount of the previous
            year&apos;s BFA).

          If the current year&apos;s State BFA is not within this transition
          range, the State formula allocation is changed to the amount of the
          transition range limit closest to the BFA amount. After having
          performed this transition adjustment for each State, the sum of the
          funds allocated to all States will differ from the amount of funds
          available for BFA. This difference, whether a positive or negative
          amount, is distributed to all States receiving a formula allocation by
          multiplying the difference by the SF. The end result is the transition
          formula allocation. The transition range will not exceed 40% (±20%),
          but when a smaller range is used it will be stated in the individual
          program section.

          Data source for each of these criterion is based on the latest census

          a State factor (SF).
