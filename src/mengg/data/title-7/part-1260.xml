          If any person appointed under this part fails or refuses to perform
          his or her duties properly or engages in acts of dishonesty or willful
          misconduct, the Board or Committee may recommend to the Secretary that
          that person be removed from office. If the Secretary finds that the
          recommendation demonstrates adequate cause, the Secretary shall remove
          the person from office. A person appointed or certified under this
          part or any employee of the Board or Committee may be removed by the
          Secretary if the Secretary determines that the person&apos;s continued
          service would be detrimental to the purposes of the Act.

             In the States listed in the following chart there exists a
            requirement that cattle be brand inspected by State authorized
            inspectors prior to sale. In addition, when cattle are sold in the
            sales transactions listed below in those States, these State
            authorized inspectors are authorized to, and shall, except as
            provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, collect assessments
            due as a result of the sale of cattle. In those transactions in
            which inspectors are responsible for collecting assessments, the
            person paying the producer shall not be responsible for the
            collection and remittance of such assessments. The following chart
