          The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the requirements
          designed to implement the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure
          Act of 1978. The regulations require that a foreign person who
          acquires, disposes of, or holds an interest in United States
          agricultural land shall disclose such transactions and holdings to the
          Secretary of Agriculture. In particular, the regulations establish a
          system for the collection of information by the Agricultural
          Stablization and Conservation Service (FSA) pertaining to foreign
          investment in United States agricultural land. The information
          collected will be utilized in the preparation of periodic reports to
          Congress and the President by the Economic Research Service (ERS)
          concerning the effect of such holdings upon family farms and rural
          communities.

             Agricultural land means land in the United States used for forestry
            production and land in the United States currently used for, or, if
            currently idle, land last used within the past five years, for
            farming, ranching, or timber production, except land not exceeding
            ten acres in the aggregate, if the annual gross receipts from the
            sale of the farm, ranch, or timber products produced thereon do not
            exceed $1,000. Farming, ranching, or timber production includes, but
            is not limited to, activities set forth in the Standard Industrial
            Classification Manual (1987), Division A, exclusive of industry
            numbers 0711-0783, 0851, and 0912-0919 which cover animal trapping,
            game management, hunting carried on as a business enterprise,
            trapping carried on as a business enterprise, and wildlife
            management. Land used for forestry production means, land exceeding
            10 acres in which 10 percent is stocked by trees of any size,
            including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be
            naturally or artificially regenerated.
