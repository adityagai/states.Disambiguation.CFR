             There is hereby established a National Fluid Milk Processor
            Promotion Board of 20 members, 15 of whom shall represent geographic
            regions and five of whom shall be at-large members of the Board. To
            the extent practicable, members representing geographic regions
            shall represent fluid milk processing operations of differing sizes.
            No fluid milk processor shall be represented on the Board by more
            than three members. The at-large members shall include at least
            three fluid milk processors and at least one member from the general
            public. Except for the non-processor member or members from the
            general public, nominees appointed to the Board must be active
            owners or employees of a fluid milk processor. The failure of such a
            member to own or work for such fluid milk processor shall disqualify
            that member for membership on the Board except that such member
            shall continue to serve on the Board for a period not to exceed 6
            months following the disqualification or until appointment of a
            successor Board member to such position, whichever is sooner,
            provided that such person continues to meet the criteria for serving
