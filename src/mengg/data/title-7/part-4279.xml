             This is a key function of all lenders during the loan processing
            phase. The lender must analyze all credit factors associated with
            each proposed loan and apply its professional judgment to determine
            that the credit factors, considered in combination, ensure loan
            repayment. The lender must have an adequate underwriting process to
            ensure that loans are reviewed by other than the originating
            officer. There must be good credit documentation procedures.

             Lenders have a responsibility to become familiar with Federal
            environmental requirements; to consider, in consultation with the
            prospective borrower, the potential environmental impacts of their
            proposals at the earliest planning stages; and to develop proposals
            that minimize the potential to adversely impact the environment.
            Lenders must alert the Agency to any controversial environmental
            issues related to a proposed project or items that may require
            extensive environmental review. Lenders must help the borrower
            prepare Form FmHA 1940-20, “Request for Environmental Information”
            (when required by subpart G of

             Demonstrate to the Agency&apos;s satisfaction that it has a
            thorough knowledge of commercial lending. The lender will
            demonstrate such knowledge by providing a summary of its guaranteed
            and unguaranteed business lending activity. At a minimum, the
            summary must include the dollar amount and number of loans in the
            lender&apos;s portfolio, unguaranteed and guaranteed by any Federal
            agency, with information on delinquencies and losses and, if
            applicable, the performance of the lender as a Small Business
            Administration (SBA) certified or preferred lender. A certified
            lender must be recognized throughout the State as a commercial
            lender and have a track record of successfully making at least five
            commercial loans per year for at least the most recent 5 years, with
            delinquent commercial loans outstanding not exceeding 6 percent of
            commercial loans outstanding and historic losses not exceeding 6
            percent of dollars loaned, or it must demonstrate that it has
            personnel with equivalent previous experience where the commercial
            loan portfolio was of a similar quantity and quality. The lender
            will provide a written certification to this effect along with a
            statistical analysis of its commercial loan portfolio for the last 3
            of its fiscal years.

            branches or suboffices may submit loans as regular lenders or apply
            for their own CLP status. Any lender who desires CLP status must
            prepare a written request to the State Director where it desires CLP

             Renewal of CLP status is not automatic. CLP status will lapse upon
            the expiration date of Form 4279-8 unless the lender obtains a
            renewal. A lender whose CLP status has lapsed may continue to submit
            loan guarantee requests as a regular lender. A new Form 4279-8
            completed and executed by the lender must be provided, along with a
            written update of the eligibility criteria required by this section
            for CLP approval. This information must be supplied at least 60 days
            prior to the expiration of the existing agreement to be assured of
            uninterrupted status. The information must address how the lender is
            complying with each of the required criteria described in paragraph
            (b) of this section. It must include any proposed changes in the
            designated persons for processing guaranteed loans or operating
            methods used in processing and servicing Agency guaranteed loans.

            provision for interest on interest. In addition, the guarantee will
            be unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned
            by the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to
            obtain the required security regardless of the time at which the
            Agency acquires knowledge thereof. Any losses occasioned will be

            other than those specifically approved by the Agency in its

            shall succeed to all rights of the lender under the Loan Note
            Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will
            remain bound to all obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee,
            Lender&apos;s Agreement, and the Agency program regulations. A
            guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable
            by a holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by the
            lender or any unenforceability of the guarantee by the lender,

            knowledge at the time it became the holder or in which the holder
            participates or condones. The lender will reimburse the Agency for
            any payments the Agency makes to a holder of lender&apos;s
            guaranteed loan that, under the Loan Note Guarantee, would not have
            been paid to the lender

             The entire loan is evidenced by one note, and one Loan Note
            Guarantee is issued. The lender may assign all or part of the
            guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more holders by using the
            Agency&apos;s Assignment Guarantee Agreement. The holder, upon
            written notice to the lender and the Agency, may reassign the unpaid
            guaranteed portion of the loan sold under the Assignment Guarantee
            Agreement. Upon notification and completion of the assignment
            through the use of Form 4279-6, the assignee shall succeed to all
            rights and obligations of the holder thereunder. If this option is
            selected, the lender may not at a later date cause any additional
            notes to be issued.

             A lender has the option to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion
            of the loan from a holder within 30 days of written demand by the
            holder when the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on
            principal or interest due on the loan; or the lender has failed to
            remit to the holder its pro rata share of any payment made by the
            borrower within 30 days of the lender&apos;s receipt thereof. The
            repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the unpaid
            guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the
            lender&apos;s servicing fee. The holder must concurrently send a
            copy of the demand letter to the Agency. The guarantee will not
            cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan
            accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the
            lender requesting the repurchase. The lender will accept an
            assignment without recourse from the holder upon repurchase. The
            lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the
            accounting of funds, resolve the problem, and prevent default, where
            and when reasonable. The lender will notify the holder and the
            Agency of its decision.

             If the lender does not repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of
            the loan as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency
            will purchase from the holder the unpaid principal balance of the
            guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of
            repurchase, less the lender&apos;s servicing fee, within 30 days
            after written demand to the Agency from the holder. (This is in
            addition to the copy of the written demand on the lender.) The
            guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the
            guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original
            demand letter of the holder to the lender requesting the repurchase.

             The holder&apos;s demand to the Agency must include a copy of the

            evidence of its right to require payment from the Agency. Such

            Guarantee properly endorsed to the Agency or the original of the
            Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to the Agency
            without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the
            loan. The holder must include in its demand the amount due including
            unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand, and interest
            subsequently accruing from date of demand to proposed payment date.
            The Agency will be subrogated to all rights of the holder.

             The Agency will notify the lender of its receipt of the
            holder&apos;s demand for payment. The lender must promptly provide
            the Agency with the information necessary for the Agency to
            determine the appropriate amount due the holder. Upon request by the
            Agency, the lender will furnish a current statement certified by an
            appropriate authorized officer of the lender of the unpaid principal
            and interest then owed by the borrower on the loan and the amount
            then owed to any holder. Any discrepancy between the amount claimed
            by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be
            resolved between the lender and the holder before payment will be
            approved. Such conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day
            payment requirement.

            <PRTPAGE P='801' />
            guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to adequately service
            the loan, the holder must sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to
            the lender for an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest
            on such portion less the lender&apos;s servicing fee. The guarantee
            will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed
            loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter of
            the lender or the Agency to the holder requesting the holder to
            tender its guaranteed portion. The lender must not repurchase from
            the holder for arbitrage or other purposes to further its own
            financial gain. Any repurchase must only be made after the lender
            obtains the Agency&apos;s written approval. If the lender does not
            repurchase the portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its
            option, purchase such guaranteed portion for servicing purposes.

            instrument. Should such note be replaced, the terms of the note

             The purpose of the B&amp;I Guaranteed Loan Program is to improve,
            develop, or finance business, industry, and employment and improve
            the economic and environmental climate in rural communities. This
            purpose is achieved by bolstering the existing private credit
            structure through the guarantee of quality loans which will provide
            lasting community benefits. It is not intended that the guarantee
            authority will be used for marginal or substandard loans or for
            relief of lenders having such loans.

        <P>
          For all new loans there are two types of non-refundable guarantee fees
          to be paid by the lender. The fees may be passed on to the borrower.
          The fees may be forwarded to the Agency through an electronic funds
          transfer system or, at the Agency&apos;s discretion, by a check
          payable to USDA using a USDA-approved form.

             The initial fee is paid at the time the Loan Note Guarantee is
            issued. The fee may be included as an eligible loan purpose in the
            guaranteed loan. The fee will be the rate (a specified percentage
            not to exceed 2 percent) multiplied by the principal loan amount,
            multiplied by the percent of guarantee. Subject to specified annual
            limits set by the Agency, the initial guarantee fee may be reduced
            to 1 percent if the borrower&apos;s business supports value-added
            agriculture and results in farmers benefiting financially, or

             Annual renewal fees are due on January 31. Payments not received by
            April 1 are considered delinquent and, at the Agency&apos;s
            discretion, may result in cancellation of the guarantee to the
            lender. Holders&apos; rights will continue in effect as specified in
            the Loan Note Guarantee and Assignment Guarantee Agreement. Any
            delinquent annual renewal fees will bear interest at the note rate
            and will be deducted from any loss payment due the lender. For loans
            where the Loan Note Guarantee is issued between October 1 and
            December 31, the first annual renewal fee payment will be due
            January 31 of the second year following the date the Loan Note
            Guarantee was issued.

            financing only when the guaranteed loan funds are used to finance a

          The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated between
          the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or variable as
          long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates will not be more than those
          rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the
          ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and
          approval. Lenders are encouraged to utilize the secondary market 
          <PRTPAGE P='808' />
          and pass interest-rate savings on to the borrower.

             A variable interest rate agreed to by the lender and borrower must
            be a rate that is tied to a base rate agreed to by the lender and
            the Agency. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different
            intervals during the term of the loan, but the adjustments may not
            be more often than quarterly and must be specified in the Loan
            Agreement. The lender must incorporate, within the variable rate
            Promissory Note at loan closing, the provision for adjustment of
            payment installments coincident with an interest-rate adjustment.
            The lender will ensure that the outstanding principal balance is
            properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity to eliminate
            the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan.

             Any change in the interest rate between the date of issuance of the

             A minimum of 10 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be
            required for existing businesses at loan closing. A minimum of 20
            percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for new
            businesses at loan closing. For energy projects, the minimum
            tangible balance sheet equity requirement range will be between 25
            percent and 40 percent. Criteria for considering the minimum equity
            required for an individual application will be based on: existing
            businesses with successful financial and management history vs.
            start-up businesses; personal/corporate guarantees offered;
            contractual relationships with suppliers and buyers; credit rating;
            and strength of the business plan/feasibility study. Where the
            application is a request to refinance outstanding Federal direct or
            guaranteed loans, without any new financing, the equity requirement
            may be determined using adjusted tangible net worth. An application
            that combines a refinancing guarantee request with a new loan
            guarantee request is subject to the standard, unadjusted, equity
            requirement except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii)

             The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal
            lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the
            loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will neither be paid
            first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed
            portion. A parity or junior position may be considered provided that
            discounted collateral values are adequate to secure the loan in
            accordance with paragraph (b) of this section after considering
            prior liens.

             If specific circumstances warrant and the proposed guaranteed loan
            will exceed $3 million, the Agency may require annual audited
            financial statements. For example, the need for audited financial
            statements will be carefully considered in connection with loans
            that depend heavily on inventory and accounts receivable for
            collateral.

          Lenders will be responsible for ensuring that appraisal values
          adequately reflect the actual value of the collateral. All real
          property appraisals associated with Agency guaranteed loanmaking and
          servicing transactions will meet the requirements contained in the
          Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)
          of 1989 and the appropriate guidelines contained in Standards 1 and 2
          of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP).
          In accordance with USPAP, the Agency will require documentation that
          the appraiser has the necessary experience and competency to appraise
          the property in question. All appraisals will include consideration of
          the potential effects from a release of hazardous substances or
          petroleum products or other environmental hazards on the market value
          of the collateral. For additional guidance and information concerning
          the completion of real property appraisals, refer to “Standard
          Practices for Environmental Site Assessments: Transaction Screen
          Questionnaire” and “Phase I Environmental Site Assessment,” both
          published by the American Society of Testing and Materials. Chattels
          will be evaluated in accordance with normal banking practices and
          generally accepted methods of determining value.

             Unconditional personal and corporate guarantees are part of the
            collateral for the loan, but are not considered in determining
            whether a loan is adequately secured for loanmaking purposes. Agency
            approved personal and corporate guarantees for the full term of the
            loan and at least equal to the guarantor&apos;s percent interest in
            the borrower, times the loan amount are required from those owning
            at least a 20 percent interest in the borrower, unless the lender
            documents to the Agency&apos;s satisfaction that collateral, equity,
            cashflow, and profitability indicate an above-average ability to
            repay the loan. The guarantors will execute an Agency approved
            unconditional guarantee form. When warranted by an Agency assessment
            of potential financial risk, Agency approved guarantees may also be
            required of parent, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies (owning
            less than a 20 percent interest in the borrower) and require
            security for any guarantee provided under this section.

             Priorities will be assigned by the Agency to eligible applications
            on the basis of a point system as contained in this section. The
            application and supporting information will be used to determine an
            eligible proposed project&apos;s priority for available guarantee
            authority. All lenders, including CLP lenders, will consider Agency
            priorities when choosing projects for guarantee. The lender will
            provide necessary information related to determining the score, as

        <P>
          Borrowers and lenders are encouraged to file preapplications and
          obtain Agency comments before completing an application. However, if
          they prefer, they may file a complete application as the first contact
          with the Agency. Neither preapplications nor applications will be
          accepted or processed unless a lender has agreed to finance the
          proposal. Guaranteed loans of $600,000 and less may be processed under
          paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, but guaranteed loans exceeding
          $600,000 must be processed under paragraph (b) of this section.

             The new lender&apos;s servicing capability, eligibility, and
            experience will be analyzed by the Agency prior to approval of the
            substitution. The original lender will provide the Agency with a
            letter stating the reasons it no longer desires to be a lender for
            the project. The substituted lender must execute a new part B of
            Form 4279-1.

          A 3-year set aside of B&amp;I Guaranteed Loan Program funds has been
          established in the National Office to fund loans to lamb processors
          for real estate purchases and improvements; working capital; debt
          refinancing; and upgrading, replacing, and installing new processing
          and packaging equipment for domestic lamb packing and processing
          plants. The set aside is $15 million for FY 2001, $5 million for FY
          2002, and $5 million for FY 2003. These funds will be available
          through the third quarter of each respective year and, if not used,
          will revert for use in the general program.

          If the Agency determines that it cannot execute the Loan Note
          Guarantee, the Agency will promptly inform the lender of the reasons
          and give the lender a reasonable period within which to satisfy the
          objections. If the lender requests additional time in writing and
          within the period allowed, the Agency may grant the request. If the
          lender satisfies the objections within the time allowed, the guarantee
          will be issued.

             Units of local government may petition the Under Secretary of Rural
            Development for a “rural in character” designation by submitting a
            petition to both the appropriate Rural Development State Director
            and the Administrator on behalf of the Under Secretary. The petition
            shall document how the area meets the requirements of paragraph
            (6)(i)(A) or (B) above and discuss why the petitioner believes the
            area is “rural in character,” including, but not limited to, the
            area&apos;s population density, demographics, and topography and how
            the local economy is tied to a rural economic base. Upon receiving a
            petition, the Under Secretary will consult with the applicable
            Governor or leader in a similar position and request comments to be
            submitted within 5 business days, unless such comments were
            submitted with the petition. The Under Secretary will release to the
            public a notice of a petition filed by a unit of local government
            not later than 30 days after receipt of the petition by way of
            publication in a local newspaper and posting on the Agency&apos;s
            Web site, and the Under Secretary will make a determination not less
            than 15 days, but no more than 60 days, after the release of the
            notice. Upon a negative determination, the Under Secretary will
            provide to the petitioner an opportunity to appeal a determination
            to the Under Secretary, and the petitioner will have 10 business
            days to appeal the determination and provide further information for
            consideration.

            project costs. Total Federal participation will not exceed 80
            percent of total eligible project costs. The borrower needs to
            provide the remaining 20 percent from other non-Federal sources to
            complete the project. Eligible project costs are specified in
            paragraph (e) of this section.

             The maximum principal amount of a loan guaranteed under this
            subpart is $250 million to one borrower; there is no minimum amount.
            If an eligible borrower receives other direct Federal funding (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.,
            </E>
             direct loans and grants) for a project, the amount of the loan that
            the Agency will guarantee under this subpart must be reduced by the
            same amount of the other direct Federal funding that the eligible
            borrower received for the project. For example, an eligible borrower
            is applying for a loan guarantee on a $1 million project. The
            borrower provides the minimum matching requirement of 20 percent, or
            $200,000. This leaves $800,000 in other funding needed to implement
            the project. If the borrower receives no other direct Federal
            funding for this project and requests a guarantee for the $800,000,
            the Agency will consider a guarantee on the $800,000. However, if
            this borrower receives $100,000 in other direct Federal funding for
            this project, the Agency will only consider a guarantee on $700,000.

             Loans made with the proceeds of any obligation the interest on
            which is excludable from income under the Internal Revenue Code are
            ineligible. Funds generated through the issuance of tax-exempt
            obligations cannot be used to purchase the guaranteed portion of any
            Agency guaranteed loan and an Agency guaranteed loan cannot serve as
            collateral for a tax-exempt issue. The Agency may guarantee a loan
            with respect to a project at a facility that has received, or will
            receive, tax-exempt financing only when the guaranteed loan funds
            are used to finance a project that is separate and distinct from the
            activities at the facility that have been or will be financed by the
            tax-exempt obligation, and the guaranteed loan has at least a parity
            security position with the tax-exempt obligation.

            partial payments for construction work. In such cases where no
            surety is provided and the project involves pre-commercial
            technology, technology that is first of its type in the U.S., or new
            designs without sufficient operating hours to prove their merit, a

            retention. This requirement applies to both the development and

            retrofitting of existing facilities using eligible technology for
            the development of advanced biofuels. The lender must expeditiously
            report any problems in project development to the Agency.

             As part of the feasibility study required under paragraph (f) of
            this section, a detailed technical assessment is required for each
            project. The technical assessment must demonstrate that the design,
            procurement, installation, startup, operation and maintenance of the
            project will permit it to operate or perform as specified over its
            useful life in a reliable and a cost effective manner, and must
            identify what the useful life of the project is. The technical
            assessment must also identify all necessary project agreements,
            demonstrate that those agreements will be in place at or before the
            time of loan closing, and demonstrate that necessary project
            equipment and services will be available over the useful life of the
            project. The technical assessment must be based upon verifiable data
            and contain sufficient information and analysis so that a
            determination can be made on the technical feasibility of achieving
            the levels of income or production that are projected in the
            financial statements. All technical information provided must follow
            the format specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(9) of this
            section. Supporting information may be submitted in other formats.
            Design drawings and process flow charts are required as exhibits. A
            discussion of a topic identified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(9)
            of this section is 
            <PRTPAGE P='834' />
            not necessary if the topic is not applicable to the specific
            project. Questions identified in the Agency&apos;s technical review
            of the project must be answered to the Agency&apos;s satisfaction
            before the application will be approved. All projects require the
            services of an independent, third-party professional engineer.

             If there is insufficient budgetary authority during a particular
            funding period to select a higher scoring application, the Agency
            may elect to select the next highest scoring application for further
            processing. Before this occurs, the Agency will provide the borrower
            of the higher scoring application the opportunity to reduce the
            amount of its request to the amount of budgetary authority
            available. If the borrower agrees to lower its request, it must
            certify that the purposes of the project can be met, and the Agency
            must determine the project is financially feasible at the lower
            amount.
