          members and alternates from the combination of Districts 1, 2 and 3,
          one-third of such initial members and alternates shall serve only one
          fiscal year, one-third of such members and alternates shall serve only
          two fiscal years, one-third of such members and alternates shall 
          <PRTPAGE P='220' />
          serve three fiscal years; and one-half of the initial members and
          alternates from Districts 4 and 7 shall serve only one fiscal year,
          and one-half of such initial members and alternates shall serve two
          fiscal years (determination of which of the initial members and their
          alternates shall serve for 1 fiscal year, 2 fiscal years, or 3 fiscal
          years, in both instances, shall be by lot). Members and alternate
          members shall serve in such capacity for the portion of the term of
          office for which they are selected and have qualified until their
          respective successors are selected, have qualified and are appointed.
          The consecutive terms of office of grower, handler and public members
          and alternate members shall be limited to two 3-year terms, excluding
          any initial term lasting less than 3 years. The term of office of a
          member and alternate member for the same seat shall be the same. If
          this part becomes effective on a date such that the initial fiscal
          period is less than six months in duration, then the tolling of time
          for purposes of this subsection shall not begin until the beginning of
          the first 12-month fiscal period.

             The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the
            Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler
            during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient
            funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred
            during such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c)
            of this section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the
            Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure
            sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary
            relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall
            be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal
            period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the
            provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period
            before sufficient operating income is available from assessments,
            the Board may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may
            borrow money for such purposes.

             If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in
            excess of expenses incurred, the Board, with the approval of the
            Secretary, may carry over all or any portion of such excess into

            used to cover any expenses authorized by this part, and to cover
            necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of
            this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall
            be refunded proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was
            collected. Without an additional reserve level approved by the

             On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall hold a
            meeting to review sales data, inventory data, current crop forecasts
            and market conditions in order to establish an optimum supply level
            for the crop year. The optimum supply volume shall be calculated as
            100 percent of the average sales of the prior three years reduced by
            average sales that represent dispositions of exempt cherries and
            restricted percentage cherries qualifying for diversion credit for
            the same three years, unless the Board determines that it is
            necessary to recommend otherwise with respect to sales of exempt and
            restricted percentage cherries, to which shall be added a desirable
            carry-out inventory not to exceed 20 million pounds or such other
            amount as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may
            establish. This optimum supply volume shall be announced by the
            Board in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

             On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall establish a
            preliminary free market tonnage percentage which shall be calculated
            as follows: from the optimum supply computed in paragraph (a) of
            this section, the Board shall deduct the carry-in inventory to
            determine the tonnage requirements (adjusted to a raw fruit
            equivalent) for the current crop year which will be 
            <PRTPAGE P='227' />
            subtracted from the current year USDA crop forecast or by an average
            of such other crop estimates the Board votes to use. If the
            resulting number is positive, this would represent the estimated
            overproduction which would be the restricted tonnage. This
            restricted tonnage would then be divided by the sum of the crop
            forecast(s) for the regulated districts to obtain a preliminary
            restricted percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, for the
            regulated districts. If subtracting the current crop year
            requirement, computed in the first sentence from the current crop
            forecast, results in a negative number, the Board shall establish a
            preliminary free market tonnage percentage of 100 percent with a
            preliminary restricted percentage of zero. The Board shall announce
            these preliminary percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of
            this section.

             Handlers handling cherries harvested in a regulated district may
            fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in part by
            acquiring diversion certificates or by voluntarily diverting

            diversion and compliance with the provisions of this section, the
            Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion
            certificate which shall satisfy any restricted percentage or

            inspected weight of the cherries diverted.

          deem to be appropriate. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary,
          may establish such rules and regulations as are necessary and
          incidental to the administration of this section.

             In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may,
            for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in
            districts subject to volume regulation (Northwest Michigan, Central
            Michigan, New York, and Utah) who have voluntarily elected to divert
            in the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production
            which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted
            percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to
            handlers in lieu of delivering cherries.

            necessary information concerning their production. After
            verification of the volume of cherries diverted, the Board shall
            calculate the amounts of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on
            the diversion certificates and issue such certificates to growers.
            Such amounts shall be determined as follows:

             For whole block diversion, the weight of a harvested sample of 5
            percent of each diverted block, provided by the grower, will be used
            to calculate the total volume of diverted cherries to be credited on
            the diversion certificate. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres
            and elects to whole block divert a 200 acre block. If 5 percent of
            the harvested trees in the block diverted yield 80,000 pounds of
            cherries, the grower would receive a diversion certificate for
            1,600,000 pounds (80,000 pounds divided by 5 percent (.05) yields
            1,600,000 pounds). The rest of the block would remain unharvested.

          <text>
             For random row diversion, such estimated volume would be calculated
            by applying the percentage of the grower&apos;s production diverted
            to the actual average volume per acre of cherries produced and
            harvested. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and elects to
            divert 20 percent of the harvestable acreage (200 acres). The grower
            harvests the remaining 800 acres and obtains 6,400,000 pounds of
            cherries, which represents a yield per acre of 8,000 pounds. Such
            grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds of
            cherries (8,000 lbs multiplied by the 20 percent of the total
            acreage diverted; in this instance, 200 acres).

             The Board may issue diversion certificates to growers in districts
            subject to volume regulation who have voluntarily elected to divert
            in the orchard all or a portion of their tart cherry production
            which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted
            percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to
            handlers in lieu of delivering cherries. Handlers may redeem
            diversion certificates with the Board through November 1 of each
            crop year. After November 1 of the crop year that crop year&apos;s
            grower diversion certificates are no longer valid. Cherries that
            have reached a harvestable, marketable condition will be eligible
            for diversion. Diversion will not be granted to growers whose fruit
            was destroyed before it set and/or matured on the tree, or whose
            fruit is unmarketable. If marketable fruit were to be damaged or
            destroyed by acts of nature such as storms or hail diversion credit
            could be granted.

             Any grower desiring to divert cherries using methods other than
            in-orchard tank shall submit a map of the orchard or orchards to be
            diverted, along with a completed Grower Diversion Application, to
            the Board by April 15 of each crop year. The application includes a
            statement which must be signed by the grower which states that the
            grower agrees to comply with the regulations established for a tart
            cherry diversion program. Each map shall contain the grower&apos;s
            name and number assigned by the Board, the grower&apos;s address,
            block name or number when appropriate, location of orchard or
            orchards and other information which may be necessary to accomplish
            the desired diversion. On or before July 1, the grower should inform
            the Board of such grower&apos;s intention to divert in-orchard and
            what type of diversion will be used. The four types of diversion are
            random row diversion, whole block diversion, partial block diversion
            and in-orchard tank diversion. A grower who informs the Board about
            the type of diversion he or she wishes to use by July 1 can elect to
            use any diversion method or combination of diversion methods. Only
            random row or in-orchard tank diversion methods may be used if the
            Board is not so informed by July 1. Trees that are four years or
            younger do not qualify for diversion. Annual resubmissions of either
            the map or application will no longer be required. Growers will only
            submit a new application and map if they are participating in the
            grower diversion program for the first time. Growers will need only
            to submit a new orchard map if he/she adds a new block of trees to
            the orchard or changes the orchard layout differently from the map
            previously submitted to the Board.

             Using the orchard map furnished by the grower, the Board will
            randomly select rows of trees within the orchard to be diverted. The
            amount of cherries to be diverted will be based on the preliminary
            restricted percentage amount established pursuant to 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

              </subref>
            </aref>
            . A grower may elect a different percentage amount; however, the
            grower needs to inform the Board as soon as possible after the
            preliminary percentages are announced of this other amount, but in
            no event shall this be less than seven days in advance of harvest.
            The designated rows indicated by the map must not be harvested.
            After completing harvest of the remaining rows in the orchard, the
            grower must notify the Board and/or the Board&apos;s compliance
            officer. A compliance officer will then be allowed to observe the
            grower&apos;s orchard to assure that the selected rows have not been
            harvested. The grower must inform the Board of the total production
            of the orchard to calculate the tonnage that was diverted.

             Based on maps supplied by the grower, a sampling procedure will be
            used to determine the amount of cherries in the orchard to be
            diverted. A block is defined as rows that run in the same direction,
            are similar in age, and have definable boundaries. The Board will
            require a number of tree sites to be sampled depending on the size
            of the block. A tree site is a planted tree or an area where a tree
            was planted and may have been uprooted or died. If a block has 5
            rows or less, or 200 or less tree sites, 3 rows would be randomly
            chosen to be sampled, if a block has 6 to 15 rows, or 201-400 tree
            sites, 4 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled, and if a block
            has 16 or more rows and greater than 400 tree sites, 5 rows would be
            randomly chosen to be sampled. The Board&apos;s compliance officer
            will apply the sampling procedure (based on the number of rows or
            the number of tree sites) which results in the fewest number of tree
            sites required to be sampled. From each of the rows to be sampled,
            ten contiguous tree sites will be sampled. Only trees more than five
            years old will be harvested for the sample. For example, if it is
            determined that five rows are to be sampled, 10 contiguous tree
            sites in each of the five rows will be subject to harvest. Trees
            within the 10 sites which are more than five years old will be
            harvested. The harvested tonnage will be converted to a volume that
            represents the entire block of cherries. If, for example, a total of
            4,600 pounds is harvested from the sample tree sites and this total
            is divided by 50 tree sites a yield of 92 pounds per tree site is
            obtained. To find the total yield for the block, the 92 pounds per
            tree site yield is multiplied by the 880 tree sites that were mapped
            in the block and that equals 80,960 pounds for that block. The
            compliance officer would be allowed access to the block to oversee
            the sampling process and to confirm that the block has been
            diverted.

            of a grower&apos;s total number of blocks per year. Such block(s)
            must be mapped and will be sampled as described under whole block

             Handlers may divert cherries by redeeming grower diversion
            certificates, by destroying cherries at handlers&apos; facilities
            (at-plant), by diverting cherry products accidentally or voluntarily
            destroyed, by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable

            diversion has taken place, handlers will receive diversion
            certificates stating the weight of cherries diverted. Diversion
            credit may be used to fulfill any restricted percentage requirement
            in full or in part. Any information of a confidential and/or

            by November 1 which shows how the handler intends to meet the
            restricted percentage obligation, except that, for the 1997-98
            season only, the deadline is February 5, 1998. The Board may extend
            this date in individual cases pursuant to a written request showing
            good cause why the plan cannot be provided by the due date. A
            handler will have one year to fulfill such plan. The details of the
            plan shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of

            destruction of the cherries at a handler&apos;s facility will be

             Handlers may be granted diversion credit for finished tart cherry
            products that are accidentally destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by
            the handler. To receive diversion credit under this option 
            <PRTPAGE P='240' />
            the cherry products must be owned by the handler at the time of
            accidental or voluntary destruction, be a marketable product at the
            time of processing, be included in the handler&apos;s end of the
            year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw Product Equivalent
            (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of cherries. In
            addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and disposition of
            the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector or Board
            agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the accidentally
            or voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be considered as
            accidentally destroyed if they sustain damage which renders them
            unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are
            voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an
            extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market
            channels.

             When diverting by donating cherries or cherry products to

            specified herein. For contributions to qualify for diversion credit,
            the contributed product should be marked clearly “NOT FOR RESALE”.
            The receiving organization must be approved by the Board as a
            qualified recipient of contributions of tart cherry products. Such
            organizations must be tax-exempt, must not sell the donated products
            and must be noncompetitive with other tart cherry industry sales
            outlets. Once products are donated to an organization, the Board
            must receive satisfactory documentation of the transaction. Handlers
            should provide the Board with information on how the product was
            used and the volume of product used.

             This term includes the development of new tart cherry products or
            of foods or other products in which tart cherries or tart cherry
            products are incorporated which are not presently being produced on
            a commercial basis. New product development can also include the
            production or processing of a tart cherry product using a technique
            not presently being utilized commercially in the tart cherry
            industry; an end product of the processing of raw tart cherries done
            by the industry at pack time either for resale or for
            re-manufacturing which has not been manufactured previously by the
            industry; or a processed, value-added item that includes tart cherry
            products as an ingredient which has never been marketed to consumers
            either by a handler within the industry or by a food manufacturer.
            In addition, the maximum duration of any credit activity is three
            years from the first date of shipment.

             This includes the development of markets for tart cherry products
            which are not commercially established markets and which are not
            competitive with commercial outlets presently utilized by the tart
            cherry industry (including the development of new export markets):

            </E>
             That these markets are a geographic area into which tart cherries
            or products derived from them have not been previously sold. The
            term “market expansion”, includes activities that incrementally
            expand the sale of either tart cherries or the products in which
            tart cherries are an ingredient, such as, but not limited to:
            Expansions of the geographic areas into which tart cherries or tart
            cherry products are marketed; product line extensions; significant
            improvements to or revisions of existing products; packaging
            innovations; segmentation of markets along geographic, demographic,
            or other definable characteristics; and product repositionings. In
            addition, shipments of tart cherries or tart cherry products in new
            market development and market expansion outlets are eligible for
            handler diversion credit for a period of one year from the
            handler&apos;s first date of shipment into such outlets.

          Deferment of restricted obligation.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          A handler may obtain a surety bond on restricted percentage cherries
          to be posted to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserves
          must be held. The surety bond must be posted at two times the market
          value of the quantity of cherries for which the holding obligation is
          being deferred. The Board can temporarily defer the date inventory
          reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler.
          However, this date shall not be later than 60 days prior to the end of
          the crop year. The deferment shall be conditioned on the execution and
          delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within
          30 days after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage
          under 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            § 
            <subref title='7' part='930' sect='51' psec='' tq='N'>
              930.51
            </subref>
          </aref>
          . The written undertaking (required to be secured by a bond or bonds
          with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board) must guarantee that
          on or prior to the 
          <PRTPAGE P='243' />
          deferment date requested by the handler the handler will have fully
          satisfied the restricted percentage obligation. On or prior to the
          deferment date requested by the handler, the handler will have to
          fully satisfy the restricted percentage obligation. In the event, a
          handler has posted the surety bond, reached the deferment date
          deadline and does not have cherries in the inventory reserve to cover
          his/her inventory reserve obligation, the bond will be forfeited to
          the Board. The Board will then buy cherries to fulfill that
          handler&apos;s obligation.
