             The Agency may make payments under this program to any biorefinery
            that meets the requirements of the program up to the limits
            established for the program. Based on our research and survey of
            medium-sized project costs, the Agency has determined that the
            dollar amount identified will provide adequate incentive for
            biorefineries to apply.

            fossil fuels a renewable biomass system is replacing), and the cost
            and cost-effectiveness of the renewable biomass system.

            and the Administrator on behalf of the Under Secretary. The petition
            shall document how the area meets the requirements of paragraph
            (6)(i)(A) or (6)(i)(B) of this definition and discuss why the
            petitioner believes the area is “rural in character,” including, but
            not limited to, the area&apos;s population density, demographics,
            and topography and how the local economy is tied to a rural economic
            base. Upon receiving a petition, the Under Secretary will consult
            with the applicable Governor or leader in a similar position and
            request comments to be submitted within 5 business days, unless such
            comments were submitted with the petition. The Under Secretary will
            release to the public a notice of a petition filed by a unit of
            local government not later than 30 days after receipt of the
            petition by way of publication in a local newspaper and posting on
            the Agency&apos;s Web site, and the Under Secretary will make a
            determination not less than 15 days, but no more than 60 days, after
            the release of the notice. Upon a negative determination, the Under
            Secretary will provide to the petitioner an opportunity to appeal a
            determination to the Under Secretary, and the petitioner will have
            10 business days to appeal the determination and provide further
            information for consideration.

          The Agency will evaluate projects based on the cost,
          cost-effectiveness, and capacity of projects to reduce fossil fuels.
          The cost of the project will be taken into consideration in the
          context of each project&apos;s ability to economically produce energy
          from renewable biomass to replace its dependence on fossil fuels.
          Projects with higher costs that are less efficient will not score
          well. The scoring criteria are designed to evaluate projects on simple
          payback as well as the percentage of fossil fuel reduction.

             The anticipated percent reduction in the use of fossil fuels will
            be measured using the same evidence provided by the applicant for
            measuring cost-effectiveness. However, this set of criteria will
            measure actual fossil fuel use for the 24-month period prior to
            submission of the application or for at least 12 months of data
            supported by engineering and design calculations, and site plans,
            prepared by the construction engineering firm. All fossil fuel use,
            for thermal loads as well as for electric use, will be evaluated by
            using information provided by the Energy Information Agency (EIA).
            The Agency will determine the percentage reduction of fossil fuel
            use based on and in cooperation with the applicant&apos;s submission
            of electric power provider contracts, power agreements, and utility
            billings in relation to available information from the EIA. A

          Any party obtaining a biorefinery that is participating in this
          program must request permission to participate in this program as a
          successor. The Agency may grant such request if it is determined that,
          the party is eligible, and permitting such succession would serve the
          purposes of the program. If appropriate, the Agency will require the
          consent of the previous party to such succession. Also, the Agency may
          terminate payments and demand full refund of payments made if a party
          loses control of a biorefinery whose production of heat or power from
          renewable biomass is the basis of a program payment, or otherwise
          fails to retain the ability to assure that all program obligations and
          requirements will be met.

             Based on the information provided in each payment application, the
            Agency will determine the eligible advanced biofuel production. If
            the Agency determines that the amount of advanced biofuel production
            reported in a payment application is not supported by the
            documentation submitted with the payment application, the Agency may
            reduce the production reported in the payment application.

             For each producer, the Agency will convert the production
            determined to be eligible under paragraph (c)(1) of this section
            into British Thermal Unit (BTU) equivalent using factors published
            by the Energy Information Administration (or successor
            organization). If the Energy Information Administration does not
            publish such conversion factor for a specific type of advanced
            biofuel, the Agency will use a conversion factor developed by
            another appropriate entity. If no such conversion factor exists, the

             A producer will only be paid for the advanced biofuels identified
            in the enrollment application submitted during the sign-up period
            and which are actually produced during the fiscal year. If the
            producer starts producing a new advanced biofuel or changes the type
            of advanced biofuel during the fiscal year, the producer will not
            receive any payments for those new advanced biofuels. However,
            during each sign-up period, a producer can identify new advanced
            biofuels and production levels compared to the previous year.

             When determining the quantity of eligible advanced biofuel, if an
            applicant is blending its advanced biofuel using ineligible
            feedstocks (e.g., fossil gasoline or methanol, corn kernel starch),
            only the quantity of advanced biofuel being produced from eligible
            feedstocks will be used in determining the payment rates and for
            which payments will be made.

             If the producer agrees with the Agency&apos;s determination or will

            of time (usually not to exceed 90 days) for the producer to arrange
            for repayment. The amount due will be the unauthorized payments made
            plus interest accrued beginning on the date of the demand letter at
            the interest rate stipulated until the date paid unless otherwise
            agreed, in writing, by the Agency.

             If the producer agrees with the Agency&apos;s determination or is
            willing to pay the amount in question, but cannot repay the
            unauthorized assistance within a reasonable period of time, the
            Agency will convert the unauthorized assistance amount to a loan
            provided all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)
            through (a)(3)(iii) of this section are met. Loans established under
            this paragraph will be at the Treasury interest rate in effect on
            the date the financial assistance was provided and that is
            consistent with the term length of the promissory note. In all
            cases, the receivable will be amortized per a repayment schedule
            satisfactory to the Agency that has the producer pay the
            unauthorized assistance as quickly as possible, but in no event will
            the amortization period exceed fifteen (15) years. The producer will
            be required to execute a debt instrument to evidence this
            receivable, and the best security position practicable in a manner
            that will adequately protect the Agency&apos;s interest during the
            repayment period will be taken as security.

            section will be treated by the Agency as a debt that can be
            collected by an Administrative offset, unless written agreements to

             Any debtor who wishes to reach a written agreement to repay the
            debt as an alternative to administrative offset must submit a
            written proposal for repayment of the debt, which must be received
            by the Agency within 20 calendar days of the date the notice was
            delivered to the debtor. In response, the Agency will notify the
            debtor in writing whether the proposed agreement is acceptable. In
            exercising its discretion, the Agency will balance the
            Government&apos;s interest in collecting the debt against fairness
            to the debtor.

            will be made before the end of the fiscal year and the review is not
            yet completed, payment will be deferred pending resolution of the
            review.
