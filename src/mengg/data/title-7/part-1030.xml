            the following year. Such request will contain a list of the plants
            participating in the system in the order, beginning with the last
            plant, in which the plants will be dropped from the system if the
            system fails to qualify. Each plant that qualifies as a pool plant
            within a system shall continue each month as a plant in the system
            through the following July unless the handler(s) establishing the

            the plant be deleted from the system or that the system be
            discontinued. Any plant that has been so deleted from a system, or
            that has failed to qualify in any month, will not be part of any

            written request to the market administrator no later than the 15th

            system may be reorganized to reflect such changes if a written

             may be increased or decreased, for all or part of the marketing
            area, by the market administrator if the market administrator finds
            that such adjustment is necessary to encourage needed shipments or
            to prevent uneconomic shipments. Before making such a finding, the
            market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment
            either on the market administrator&apos;s own initiative or at the
            request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at
            least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is
            desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of
            the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market
            administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is
            being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision
            to revise an applicable shipping or diversion percentage must be
            issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.
