             Any application for a protected plant permit may be denied and any
            protected plant permit which has been issued may be suspended or
            revoked for a time specified by the Deputy Administrator for any of
            the reasons provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. Before
            such action is taken, the applicant or permittee will be informed of
            the 
            <PRTPAGE P='495' />
            reasons for the proposed action, and upon request, shall be afforded
            an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity
            of such action, in accordance with rules of practice which shall be
            adopted for the proceeding. However, such denial, suspension or
            revocation may become effective pending final determination in the
            proceeding, if the permittee has been convicted or a criminal
            violation of the Act, or of any regulation, permit, or certificate
            issued under the Act. Such denial, suspension or revocation shall be
            effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier,
            to the permittee. In the event of oral notification of the denial,
            suspension or revocation, written confirmation shall be given to the
            permittee as promptly as circumstances allow. This denial,
            suspension or revocation shall continue in effect pending the
            completion of the proceeding and any judicial review thereof, unless
            otherwise ordered by the Deputy Administrator.
