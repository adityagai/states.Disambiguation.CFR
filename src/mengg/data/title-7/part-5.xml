        <P>
          It is hereby found that it is impractical to use averages of prices
          received by farmers on a calendar year basis for the following
          agricultural commodities for the purpose of calculating adjusted base
          prices and, therefore, marketing season average prices will be used.
          An allowance for any supplemental payment resulting from price support
          operations shall be included in the determination of the adjusted base
          prices. For cigar binder tobacco, types 51-52, for each of the
          marketing seasons beginning in the years 1949 through 1958, 37.9 cents
          per pound shall be used in lieu of the average of prices received by
          farmers for such tobacco during each such marketing season.

             The “modernized” parity formula specified in

              section 301(a)(1) of
            </aref>
             the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, takes into
            consideration the average prices received by farmers for
            agricultural commodities during the last ten years and is designed
            gradually to adjust relative parity prices of specific commodities
            for persistent or continuing changes in demand and supply conditions
            which are reflected in market prices. Accordingly, only in rare
            cases is it possible for the parity price of any agricultural
            commodity to become seriously out of line with the parity prices of
            other agricultural commodities. In any case, however, in which
            producers of any agricultural commodity believe that the parity
            price of such commodity, as computed pursuant to the provisions of 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 301(a)(1)
            </aref>
            , is seriously out of line with the parity prices of other
            agricultural commodities, a request for a public hearing under 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 301(a)(1)(F)
            </aref>
             may be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture by a substantial
            number of interested producers. The producers shall also furnish to
            the Secretary, with such request or separately, data supporting
            their conclusion that the parity price of such commodity is
            seriously out of line with the parity prices of other commodities.
            Upon receipt of such a request with supporting data, or at any time
            upon the Secretary&apos;s own motion, this Department will make a
            preliminary study of the relationship between the parity price of
            such commodity and the parity prices of other commodities, and if
            the Secretary concludes that there appears to be reasonable grounds
            for believing that the parity price of such commodity is seriously
            out of line with the parity prices of other agricultural
            commodities, a hearing will be held pursuant to the provisions of

            notice. The notice of hearing shall state the purpose of the hearing
            and the time and place of the hearing. The time of the hearing shall
            not be less than fifteen days after the date of publication of the
            notice in the

             unless the Secretary shall determine that an emergency exists which
            requires a shorter period of notice, in which case the period of
            notice shall be that which the Secretary determines to be reasonable
            in the circumstances.

             The hearing shall be conducted in such a way as to obtain a clear
            and orderly record. All interested persons appearing at the hearing
            shall be given reasonable opportunity to offer data, views, or
            arguments relevant to (i) whether the parity price for the
            agricultural commodity involved is or is not seriously out of line
            with the parity prices of other agricultural commodities, and (ii)
            the proper relationship between the parity price of such commodity
            and the parity prices of other agricultural commodities and the
            revisions, if any, which should be made in computing the parity
            price of such commodity. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted
            in duplicate. The presiding officer shall, insofar as possible,
            exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but
            shall not apply technical judicial rules of evidence. Every witness
            shall be subject to questioning by the presiding officer or by any
            other representative of the Department, but cross-examination by
            other persons shall not be allowed, except in the discretion of the
            presiding officer. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
            transcribed verbatim.

             As soon as possible after receipt of the recommendation, the
            Secretary shall determine whether the parity price of such commodity
            computed in accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 301(a)(1)
            </aref>
             appears to be seriously out of line with the parity prices of other
            agricultural commodities whether the facts require a revision of the
            method of computing the parity price of such commodity, and the
            revision, if any, which is required in the method of computing the
            parity price of such commodity. Such determination by the Secretary
            shall be final. The Secretary&apos;s determination shall be filed
            with the Hearing Clerk who shall cause the determination to be
            published promptly in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register.
            </E>
             The Hearing Clerk shall also mail a copy of the determination to
            each producer and grower organization which participated in or is
            known to be interested in the hearing. Upon application to the
            Hearing Clerk, any person shall be entitled to a copy of the
            determination.
