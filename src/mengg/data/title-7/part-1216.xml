          person is the alternate, shall act in the place and stead of such

          for that state or at-large member shall act for the member until a
          successor for such member is selected and qualified. In the event that
          both a producer member of the Board and the alternate are unable to
          attend a meeting, the Board may not designate any other alternate to
          serve in such member&apos;s or alternate&apos;s place and stead for

            determine whether peanut producers favor the continuation of the

            a referendum. In addition, the Secretary may hold a referendum at
            any time.
