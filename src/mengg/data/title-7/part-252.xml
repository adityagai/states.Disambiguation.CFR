             This part provides a program whereby the Food and Nutrition Service
            (FNS) and private processors of food may enter into agreements under
            which the processor will process and distribute designated donated
            food to eligible recipient agencies. The intent of the program is to
            encourage private industry, acting in cooperation with the States
            and FNS, to develop new markets in which donated food may be
            utilized. It is expected that the processors will use their
            marketing abilities to encourage eligible recipient agencies to
            participate in the program. Additionally, recipient agencies will
            benefit by being able to purchase processed end products at a
            substantially reduced price.

            submitted by the processor. Under no circumstances should the amount
            of donated food requested by the processor be more than the
            processor can accept and store at any one time. FNS will make no
            further distribution to a processor whose inventory exceeds these
            limits until such time as the inventory is reduced.

             Any food processor is eligible to apply for participation in the
            NCP Program. Agreement applications may be filed with FNS at any
            time on an FNS-approved form. FNS will accept or reject the
            application of each individual food processor within 30 days from
            the date of receipt, except that FNS may, at its discretion, extend
            such period if it needs more information in order to make its
            determination. In determining whether to accept or reject an
            application, FNS shall take into consideration at least the
            following matters: the financial responsibility of the applicant;
            the ability of the applicant to meet the terms and conditions of the
            regulations and the NCP agreement; ability to accept and store
            commodities in minimum truckload quantities; historical performance
            under the State and NCP processing programs; anticipated new markets
            for NCP end products; geographic areas served by the processor; the
            ability of the applicant to distribute processed products to
            eligible recipient agencies; and a satisfactory record of integrity,
            business ethics and performance. In addition, the processors must
            demonstrate their ability to sell end products under NCP by
            submitting supporting documentation such as written intent to
            purchase, bids awarded, or historical sales performance. FNS will
            make a final determination based on all available documentation
            submitted.

            to recipient agencies through a distributor without dual billing,
            processors shall provide refunds to the distributor and ensure that
            the distributor provides discounts of equal value to recipient
            agencies. Under this system, the processor shall sell end products
            to a distributor at the processor&apos;s commercial/gross price for
            the end product. The processor&apos;s invoice shall reflect the
            value of commodities contained in the end product as established by
            the agreement. The processor shall ensure that the distributor
            submits a refund application to the processor within 30 days after
            the eligible recipient agency receives the processed end product.
            The processor shall ensure that the refund application includes
            documentation of the purchase of end products by the eligible
            recipient agency through substantiating invoices and that the
            recipient agency has purchased the end product at the net case price
            which reflects the value of the discount established by the
            agreement. Within 30 days of the receipt of the refund application,
            the processor shall issue payment directly to the distributor in an
            amount equal to the stated agreement value of the donated food
            contained in the purchased end products covered by the application.
            In no event shall refund applications for purchases during the
            period of agreement be accepted by the processors later than 60 days
            after the close of the agreement period. The processor shall verify
            a statistically valid sample of discount sales made by distributors
            without dual billing in a manner which ensures a 95 percent
            confidence level. All such sales reported during a quarter shall be
            verified at the end of that quarter. Processors shall verify that
            sales were made only to eligible recipient agencies and that the
            value of donated commodities was passed through to those recipient
            agencies. The processor shall report to FNS the level of invalid or
            inaccurate sales identified in each quarter within 60 days after the
            close of each quarter. At the same time such report is submitted,
            the processor shall submit to FNS a corrective action plan designed
            to correct problems identified in the verification effort. The
            processor shall adjust performance reports to reflect the invalid
            sales identified during the verification effort required by this
            paragraph. If, as a result of this verification, FNS determines that
            the value of donated food has not been passed on the recipient
            agencies or that end products have been improperly distributed, FNS
            may assert a claim against the processor.

            paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section or an alternative system
            approved by FNS. If an alternative system is approved, FNS will
            notify the States in which the system will be used. The Department
            retains the authority to inspect and review all pertinent records
            under all VPT systems, including the verification of a required
            statistically valid sample of sales. FNS may consider the paperwork

            systems when considering approval and reserves the right to deny 
            <PRTPAGE P='599' />

             If requested by FNS, each recipient agency shall cooperate in the
            verification of end product sales reported by processors under the
            NCP Program. The recipient agency may be requested to verify actual
            purchases of end products as substantiated by the recipient
            agency&apos;s invoices and may also be requested to verify that the
            invoice correctly identifies the discount included or refund due for
            the value of the donated ingredient contained in the end product.

             If a processor improperly distributes or uses any donated food, or
            causes loss of or damage to a donated food through its failure to
            provide proper storage, care, or handling, FNS shall require the

            determined by the Department.

             Donated food which is found to be damaged or out-of-condition and

            health officials, or by any other inspection services or persons
            deemed competent by the Department, shall be disposed of in
            accordance with instructions of the Department. This instruction
            shall direct that unfit donated food be sold in a manner prescribed
            by the Department with the net proceeds thereof remitted to the
            Department. Upon a finding by the Department that donated food is
            unfit for human consumption at the time of delivery to a recipient
            agency and when the Department or appropriate health officials
            require that such donated food be destroyed, the processor shall pay
            for any expenses incurred in connection with such donated food as
            determined by the Department. The Department may, in any event,
            repossess damaged or out-of-condition donated food.

             FNS may conduct a verification of processor reported sales
            utilizing a statistically valid sampling technique. If, as a result
            of this verification, FNS determines that the value of the donated
            food has not been passed on to recipient agencies or if end products
            have been improperly distributed, FNS may assert a claim against the
            processor. This claim may include a projection of the verification
            sample to the total NCP sales reported by the processor.
