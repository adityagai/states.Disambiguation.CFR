            result of the original inspection, the commodity was found to be
            contaminated with filthy, putrid, and decomposed material. If it is
            determined that the sampling procedures were improper, a new sample
            shall be obtained.

        <P>
          Appeal inspection or grading may be obtained by filing a request
          therefore, (a) with the Administrator, (b) with the inspector or
          grader who issued the inspection or grading certificate or report with
          respect to which the appeal service is requested, or (c) with the
          supervisor of such inspector or grader. The application for appeal
          inspection or grading shall state the reasons therefore, and may be
          accompanied by a copy of the aforesaid inspection or grading
          certificate or report or any other information the applicant may have
          secured regarding the product or the service from which the appeal is
          requested. Such application may be made orally (in person or by
          telephone), in writing, or by telegraph. If made orally, written
          confirmation may be required.

          The Administrator may refuse an application for an appeal inspection
          or grading when (a) the quality or condition of the products has
          undergone a material change since the time of original service, (b)
          the identical products inspected or graded cannot be made accessible
          for reinspection or regrading, (c) the conditions under which
          inspection service was performed have changed, (d) it appears that the
          reasons for an appeal inspection or grading are frivolous or not
          substantial, or (e) the Act or this part have not been complied with.
          The applicant shall be promptly notified of the reason for such
          refusal.

          For good cause and in instances of willful wrongdoing, the
          Administrator may suspend any license issued under the regulations in
          this subpart by giving notice of such suspension to the respective
          individual involved, accompanied by a statement of reasons therefor.
          Within 10 days after receipt of the 
          <PRTPAGE P='91' />
          aforesaid notice and statement of reasons by such individual, he may
          file an appeal in writing with the Administrator supported by any
          argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to why his license
          should not be suspended or revoked. In conjunction therewith, he may
          request and, in such event, shall be accorded an oral hearing. After
          consideration of such argument and evidence, the Administrator will
          take such action as warranted with respect to such suspension or
          revocation. When no appeal is filed within the prescribed 10 days, the
          license is revoked.

             Adoption of certain sound practices at dairy plants will
            significantly aid the operators to manufacture more consistently,
            uniform high-quality stable dairy products. Only dairy products
            manufactured, processed and packaged in an approved plant may be
            graded or inspected and identified with official identification. The
            specifications established herein provide the basis for a quality
            maintenance program which may be effectively carried forward through
            official inspection, grading, and quality control service.

            vacuum breaker and a positive activated check valve on the product
            inlet side and a vacuum breaker and a positive activated check valve
            on the discharge side. If direct steam is used, it should also be
            equipped with a ratio controller to regulate the composition when
            applicable to the finished product. Only steam which meets the
            requirements for culinary steam shall be used. The incoming steam
            supply shall be regulated by an automatic solenoid valve which will

            safety shutoff valve.

          of each producer whose milk tests positive for drug residue, exceeds
          the maximum somatic cell count level, or does not meet the

          Washers shall be maintained in a clean and satisfactory operating
          condition and kept free from accumulation of scale or debris which
          will adversely affect the efficiency of the washer. Only washing
          compounds which are compatible with the water for effective cleaning,
          should be used. The can washer should be checked regularly during the
          run for proper operation. At the end of the day, the wash and rinse
          tanks should be drained and cleaned, jets and strainers cleaned, air
          filters checked and changed or cleaned if needed, and checks should be
          made for proper adjustment and condition of mechanical parts.

          practical. Care shall be taken in the storage of any other product
          foreign to dairy products in the same room, in order to prevent
          impairment or damage to the dairy product from mold, absorbed odors,
          or vermin or insect infestation. Control of humidity and temperature
          shall be maintained at all times, consistent with good commercial

             The lined butter containers shall be protected from possible

            accomplished by alternately inverting one container over the other
            or stacking the lined boxes on their sides in a rack, until ready
            for use. When using polyethylene liners the boxes should be lined
            immediately prior to use. When packing butter into the bulk
            containers, care shall be taken to fill the corners leaving as few
            holes or openings as possible. The surface of the butter as well as
            the covering liner shall be smoothed evenly over the top surface
            before closing and sealing the container. Containers should be
            stacked only as high as the firmness of the product will support
            weight, so as not to crush or distort the container.

        <P>
          To as great an extent as is practical, each vat of cheese should be
          divided and distributed throughout numerous cooker batches. The
          purpose being to minimize the preponderance and consequent influence
          of any one vat on the characteristics of the finished product, and to
          promote as much uniformity as is practical. In blending also consider
          the final composition requirements for fat and moisture. Quantities of
          salt, color, emulsifier and other allowable ingredients to be added
          shall be calculated and predetermined for each cooker batch.

             “Whey” is the fluid obtained by separating the coagulum from milk,
            cream, and/or skim milk in cheesemaking. The acidity of the whey may
            be adjusted by the addition of safe and suitable pH adjusting
            ingredients. Moisture removed from cheese curd as a result of
            salting may be collected for further processing as whey if the
            collection of the moisture and the removal of the salt from the
            moisture are conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the
            Administrator.

             When one or more of the bulky optional ingredients, as approved by
            the Food and Drug Administration, are used, the weights of milk fat
            and total milk solids (excusive of such fat and solids in any malted
            milk used) are not less than 10 percent and 20 percent,
            respectively, of the remainder obtained by subtracting the weight of
            such optional ingredients, from the weight of the finished ice
            cream; but in no case is the weight of milk fat or total milk 
            <PRTPAGE P='155' />
            solids less than 8 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the
            weight of the finished ice cream. In calculating the reduction of
            milk fat and total milk solids from the use of bulky optional
            ingredients, chocolate and cocoa solids used shall be considered the
            bulky ingredients. In order to make allowance for additional
            sweetening ingredients needed when bulky ingredients are used, the
            weight of chocolate or cocoa solids may be multiplied by 2.5; the
            weight of fruit or nuts used may be multiplied by 1.4; and the
            weight of partially or wholly dried fruits or fruit juices may be
            multiplied by appropriate factors to obtain the original weights
            before drying and this weight multiplied by 1.4 The finished ice
            cream contains not less than 1.6 pounds to the gallon; except that
            when the optional ingredient microcrystalline cellulose is used, the
            finished ice cream contains not less than 1.6 pounds of total solids
            to the gallon and weighs not less than 4.5 pounds to the gallon
            exclusive, in both cases, of the weight of the microcrystalline
            cellulose.
