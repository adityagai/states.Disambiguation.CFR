          For the purposes of The Act, the classification of any cotton shall be
          determined by the quality of a sample in accordance with Universal
          Cotton Standards (the official cotton standards of the United States)
          for the color grade and the leaf grade of American upland cotton, the
          length of staple, and fiber property measurements such as micronaire.
          High Volume Instruments will determine all fiber property measurements
          except extraneous matter, special conditions and remarks. High Volume
          Instrument colormeter measurements will be used for determining the
          official color grade. Cotton classers authorized by the Cotton and
          Tobacco Programs will determine the presence of extraneous matter,
          special conditions and remarks and authorized employees of the Cotton
          and Tobacco Programs will determine all fiber property measurements
          using High Volume Instruments. The classification record of a Classing
          Office or the Quality Control Division with respect to any cotton
          shall be deemed to be the classification record of the Department.

             Where it is necessary to draw two sets of samples, a single cut

            removed from each cut should be broken in half across the layers to
            provide two complete samples. In those cases where this method would
            result in samples of insufficient length, it will be acceptable to
            split the sample lengthwise along the layers provided the outside
            portion from each side is submitted for the official classification.

          A review of any Form A, C, or D determination may be requested by the
          owner or custodian of the cotton from which the sample was drawn
          within 30 days after the issuance of the original memorandum. Such
          review shall cover all of the quality factors for which the original
          determination was made. Requests for reviews of Form A or D
          determinations may be filed with, and the review made by, the Classing
          Office which issued such memorandum or the Quality Control System.
          Requests for reviews of Form C determinations shall be filed with, and
          the reviews made by, the Quality Control System. Redrawn samples shall
          be required for reviews of Form A and Form C determinations except in
          cases where the original samples have remained, identity preserved, in
          the custody of the Division. When redrawn samples are necessary, they
          shall be drawn and submitted as prescribed in this subpart. As
          evidence of a review determination, a Form A or D memorandum or Form C
          certificate appropriately marked to indicate that it represents a
          review determination shall be issued to the applicant requesting the
          review. The applicant may be required by the Classing Office or the
          Quality Control Section issuing such review determination to surrender
          the original classification memorandum or certificate. In any event
          the review determination shall supersede and invalidate the original
          determination.

          When an association or exchange located in a country other than the
          United States shall adopt any of the official cotton standards of the
          United States and when the members of the committee of such
          association or exchange having final jurisdiction in the matter of
          appeals have been designated as cotton examiners by the Director, such
          committee may be constituted for the purposes of this act a Board of
          the Department and authorized to act as follows:

             Insofar as the exchange has adopted the universal standards the
            committee may pass upon the classification of cotton involved in a
            dispute between a party in the United States and a party without the

             Determinations of classification made by the boards so constituted
            shall be final. When so provided in the articles, rules, or bylaws
            of the association or exchange, such determinations may be evidenced
            by awards. If an award is made which does not state the
            classification, such board will, upon request of the owner or
            custodian of the cotton and the payment of a reasonable additional
            fee, issue a certificate showing in detail the true classification
            for grade and color of such cotton, based upon a comparison of the
            samples with the universal standards or with a type or other samples
            on which the cotton has been sold, as the case may be.

          determination, a classification memorandum marked to indicate that it

          requesting the review.

          If at any time funds available for services under the regulations in

          samples that may be submitted for the purpose, the Director may place
          reasonable limitations upon the quantities of samples to be submitted
          by individuals during any one fiscal year or any one calendar month,
          and may direct that samples received from cotton breeders shall take
          precedence over those received from other persons.
