            Funds. REDG Zero-Interest Loans are made by the Intermediary from
            the Revolving Loan Fund to Ultimate Recipients for the purpose of
            financing specific, approved Projects. Ultimate Recipients are
            responsible for repayment to the Intermediary. The Ultimate
            Recipient&apos;s loan repayments are to be retained in the Revolving
            Loan Fund, which is maintained by the Intermediary, to finance other
            rural economic development Projects. Only the initial loan made by
            the Intermediary from the Revolving Loan Fund has to be at zero
            interest.

            when Form RD 400-4, “Assurance Agreement,” is signed. For each loan
            or Grant an Intermediary receives, a new Form RD 400-4 must be
            completed. Each Ultimate Recipient must go through the same
            pre-award compliance review process and must also sign Form RD
            400-4. For loans and Grants, a pre-award review is required before
            loan or Grant approval or any disbursement of funds. For
            Intermediaries, a post-award compliance review is required 90 days
            after closing the loan or Grant. This review is not required for
            Ultimate Recipients. Subsequent compliance reviews will be conducted
            3 years from the date the post-award compliance review is completed
            for Intermediaries and 3 years from the date the pre-award
            compliance review is completed for Ultimate Recipients. Where Grant
            funds are used for a Revolving Loan Fund, compliance reviews are
            required for the Intermediaries for as long as the Fund is in
            operation. For Ultimate Recipients, compliance reviews are conducted
            until the loan is repaid to the Fund.

            determination not less than 15 days, but no more than 60 days, after
            the release of the notice. Upon a negative determination, the Under
            Secretary will provide to the petitioner an opportunity to appeal a

            . A business plans to build a new production line with a capacity of
            625 units per hour to replace an existing production line that
            produces 500 units per hour. The total project costs of the new
            production line is $20,000, of which $15,000 would otherwise qualify
            as eligible project costs. However, because the new production line
            has a greater production capacity than the existing line (625 units
            per hour versus 500 units per hour), only a portion of the $15,000
            of otherwise eligible project costs would be used in determining
            total eligible project cost and the maximum grant assistance
            available. In this example, because the original capacity (500 units
            per hour) is 80 percent of the new capacity (625 units per hour),
            only 80 percent of the $15,000 of otherwise eligible project costs
            associated with the new production line (

            financed under this subpart. The maximum grant award in this example
            would be $3,000, which is equal to $12,000 × 25 percent.

            service providers, trades, large construction equipment providers
            and labor are readily available domestically and familiar with
            installation procedures and practices, and spare parts and service
            are readily available in the U.S. to properly maintain and operate
            the system. All warranties must be valid in the U.S.

            protocol, the documented operating history, which may be established
            domestically or outside the U.S., should provide performance data

             Each subparagraph has its own maximum possible score and will be
            scored according to the following criteria: If the description in
            the subparagraph has no significant weaknesses and exceeds the
            requirements of the subparagraph, 100 percent of the total possible
            score for the subparagraph will be awarded. If the description has
            one or more significant strengths and meets the requirements of the
            subparagraph, 80 percent of the total possible score will be awarded
            for the subparagraph. If the description meets the basic
            requirements of the subparagraph, but also has several weaknesses,
            60 percent of the points will be awarded. If the description is
            lacking in one or more critical aspects, key issues have not been
            addressed, but the description demonstrates some merit or strengths,
            40 percent of the total possible score will be awarded. If the
            description has serious deficiencies, internal inconsistencies, or
            is missing information, 20 percent of the total possible score will
            be awarded. If the description has no merit in this area, 0 percent
            of the total possible score will be awarded. The total possible
            points for Technical Merit is 35 points.

            work, as well as construction or installation, may be used under
            this method.

             When a price has already been negotiated by an applicant and a
            contractor, the Agency will review the proposed contract. If the
            contractor is qualified to perform the development and provide a
            warranty of the work and the price compares favorably with the cost
            of similar construction in the area, further negotiation is
            unnecessary. If the Agency determines the price is too high or
            otherwise unreasonable, the applicant will be required to negotiate
            further with the contractor. If a reasonable price cannot be
            negotiated or if the contractor is not qualified, the applicant will
            be required to negotiate with another contractor.

            score for the project remains the same or is higher. Prior to
            changing a contractor or vendor, the recipient must submit to the
            Agency a written request providing information that allows the
            Agency to re-score the project&apos;s technical merit. If the Agency
            determines that the project achieves the same or higher technical
            merit score, the recipient may make the change. No additional
            funding will be available from the Agency if costs for the project
            have increased. If the Agency determines that the project does not
            achieve the same or higher technical merit score, the change will
            not be approved.

            energy efficiency improvement&apos;s total eligible project costs
            based on the capacity of the existing equipment. A calculation shall

          Example. A business plans to build a new production line with a
          capacity of 625 units per hour to replace an existing production line
          that produces 500 units per hour. The total project costs of the new
          production line is $20,000, of which $15,000 would otherwise qualify
          as eligible project costs. However, because the new production line
          has a greater production capacity than the existing line (625 units
          per hour versus 500 units per hour), only a portion of the $15,000
          otherwise eligible project costs would be used in determining total
          eligible project cost and the maximum guaranteed loan assistance
          available. In this example, because the original capacity (500 units
          per hour) is 80 percent of the new capacity (625 units per hour), only
          80 percent of the $15,000 of otherwise eligible project costs
          associated with the new production line (
          <E T='03'>
            i.e.,
          </E>
           $12,000) will be considered as total eligible project cost to be
          financed under this subpart. The maximum guaranteed loan award in this
          example would be $9,000, which is equal to $12,000 × 75 percent.

             The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated
            between the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or
            variable as long as it is a legal rate. The variable rate must be
            based on published indices, such as money market indices. In no
            case, however, shall the rate be more than the rate customarily
            charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of
            business. The interest rate charged is subject to Agency review and
            approval.

          The lender must service the entire loan and must remain mortgagee and
          secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party
          may hold a portion of the loan. The entire loan must be secured by the
          same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and
          unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of a loan
          will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over
          the guaranteed portion of the loan.

             The Agency will first determine whether the entity is eligible to
            compete for a feasibility study grant. Applications for applicants
            determined by the Agency not to be eligible will not be processed

             After determining applicant eligibility, the Agency will review the
            application to determine if the proposal is eligible. Applications
            determined by the Agency not to be eligible will not be processed
            further. The Agency will determine whether the application contains
            certification by the applicant that the applicant has not received
            any other Federal or State assistance for a feasibility study on the
            subject facility. If the application does not contain such
            certification, it is an ineligible application and the Agency will
            stop processing the application.

             As applications are funded, if insufficient funds remain to fund
            the next highest scoring application, the Agency may elect to fund a
            lower scoring application. Before this occurs, the Agency will
            provide the applicant of the higher scoring application the
            opportunity to reduce the amount of its grant request to the amount
            of funds available. If the applicant agrees to lower its grant
            request, it must certify that the purposes of the project can be
            met, and the Agency must determine the project is financially
            feasible at the lower amount.

             If there is a significant reduction in project cost or changes in
            project scope, the applicant&apos;s funding needs, eligibility, and
            scoring, as applicable, will be reassessed. Decreases in Agency
            funds will be based on revised project costs and other selection
            factors; however, other factors, including Agency regulations used
            at the time of grant approval, will remain the same. Obligated grant
            funds not needed to complete the project will be de-obligated.

            submitted to the Agency no more often than monthly to request either
            advance or reimbursement of funds. Upon receipt of a properly
            completed SF-270, the funds will be requested through the field
            office terminal system. Ordinarily, payment will be made within 30
            days after receipt of a proper request for advance or reimbursement.

           The Agency uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of
          full-time jobs as its standard definition. For purposes of this
          program, a full-time job is a job that has at least 35 hours in a work
          week. As such, one full-time job with at least 35 hours in a work week
          equals one FTE; two part-time jobs with combined hours of at least 35
          hours in a work week equals one FTE, and three seasonal jobs equals
          one FTE. If an FTE calculation results in a fraction, it should be
          rounded up to the next whole number.

             Each loan made to a microlender during its first five years of
            participation in this program will bear an interest rate of 2
            percent. After the fifth year of an MDO&apos;s continuous and
            satisfactory participation in this program, each new loan made to
            the microlender will bear an interest rate of 1 percent.
            Satisfactory participation requires a default rate of 5 percent or
            less and a pattern of delinquencies of 10 percent or less. Except in
            the case of liquidation or early repayment, loans to microlenders
            must fully amortize over the life of the loan.

             During the initial deferral period, each loan to a microlender will
            accrue interest at a rate of 1 or 2 percent based on the ultimate
            interest rate on the loan. Interest accrued during the 2-year
            deferral period will be capitalized so that, during the 24th month
            of the initial deferral period, the microlender&apos;s debt to the
            Agency will be calculated and amortized over the remaining life of
            the loan. The first payment will be due to the Agency on the last

             The LLRF account must be established by the microlender prior to
            the closing of the loan from the Agency. At the time of initial loan
            closing, sources of funding for the LLRF must be identified by the
            microlender so that as microloans are made, the amount in the LLRF
            can be built over time to an amount greater than or equal to 5
            percent of the amount owed to the Agency by the microlender under
            this program. After the first disbursement is made to a microlender,
            further disbursements will only be made if the LLRF is funded at the
            appropriate amount. After the initial loan is made to a microlender,
            subsequent loan closings will require the LLRF to be funded in an
            amount equal to 5 percent of the anticipated initial drawdown of
            funds for the RMRF. Federal funds, except where specifically
            permitted by other laws, may not be used to fund LLRF.

            application and qualification process of becoming a microlender.
            Failure to meet scoring benchmarks will preclude an applicant from
            receiving loan and/or grant dollars. Once an MDO is participating as
            a microlender, grant funds will be made available automatically
            based on lending and the availability of funds.

             The maximum TA grant amount for a microlender is 25 percent of the
            first $400,000 of outstanding microloans owed to the microlender
            under this program, plus an additional 5 percent of the outstanding
            loan amount owed by the microborrowers to the lender under this
            program over $400,000 up to and including $2.5 million. This

            made under this program and active by the microlender as of the date
            the grant is awarded for the first $400,000 plus an additional 5
            percent of the loan amount owed by the microborrowers to the lender
            under this program over $400,000 up to and including $2.5 million.
            Funds cannot be used to pay off the loans. During the first year of
            operation, the percentage will be determined based on the amount of
            the loan to the microlender, but will be disbursed on a quarterly
            basis based on the amount of microloans made. Any grant dollars
            obligated, but not spent, from the initial grant, will be subtracted
            from the subsequent year grant to ensure that obligations cover only
            microloans made and active.

          applications will be ranked together. Shortened applications can only

          microborrower success while enabling the microlender to repay the
