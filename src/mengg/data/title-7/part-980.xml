             The marketing of Irish potatoes can be reasonably distinguished by
            the several seasonal categories, i.e., winter, early spring, late
            spring, early summer, late summer, and fall. The bulk of the fall
            crop is harvested and placed in storage in the fall and marketed
            over a period of several months extending into the following summer.
            But potatoes harvested from the other seasonal crops are generally
            marketed as the potatoes are harvested. The marketing seasons for
            these crops overlap.

             The marketing of onions can be reasonably distinguished by the
            seasonal categories, i.e., late summer and early spring. The bulk of
            the late summer crop is harvested and placed in storage in late
            summer and early fall and marketed over a period of several months
            extending into the following spring. But the onions harvested from
            the early spring crop are generally marketed as soon as the onions
            are harvested. The marketing seasons for these crops overlap;

             Since inspectors may not be stationed in the immediate vicinity of
            some smaller ports of entry, importers should make advance
            arrangements for inspection by ascertaining whether or not there is
            an inspector located at their particular port of entry. For all
            ports of entry where an inspection office is not located, each
            importer must give the specified advance notice to the applicable
            office listed below prior to the time the onions will be imported.

            of some smaller ports of entry, importers should make advance
            arrangements for inspection by ascertaining whether or not there is
            an inspector located at their particular port of entry. For all
            ports of entry where an inspection office is not located, each
            importer must give the specified advance notice to the applicable
            office listed below prior to the time the tomatoes will be imported.

             It is the responsibility of the importer to notify the Marketing
            Order Administration Branch of any lot of exempt commodity rejected
            by a receiver, shipped to an alternative exempt receiver, returned
            to the country of origin, or otherwise disposed of. In such cases, a
            second “Importer&apos;s Exempt Commodity Form” must be filed by the
            importer providing sufficient information to determine ultimate
            disposition of the exempt lot and such disposition shall be so
            certified by the final receiver.
