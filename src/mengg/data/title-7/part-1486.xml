             The principal purpose of the EMP is to assist U.S. entities in
            developing, maintaining, or expanding the exports of U.S.
            agricultural commodities and products by providing partial funding
            for technical assistance activities that promote U.S. agricultural
            exports to emerging markets, a consistent with U.S. foreign policy
            interests. The Program is intended primarily to support export
            market development efforts of the private sector, but the
            Program&apos;s resources may also be used to assist public
            agricultural organizations as well. Technical assistance may include
            activities such as feasibility studies, market research, sector
            assessments, orientation visits, specialized training, business
            workshops, and similar undertakings.

            export of another country&apos;s products to the United States, or

          The World Bank periodically redefines the income limits on upper

          CCC has established three pools of funding within the EMP—the Central
          Fund, the Quick Response Marketing Fund, and the Technical Issues
          Resolution Fund. Each year CCC will inform the public of the process
          by which interested eligible entities may submit proposals for funding
          under the Central Fund. Because of the time sensitive nature of issues
          intended to be addressed, the Quick Response Marketing Fund and the
          Technical Issues Resolution Fund will be available continuously with
          no application deadline.

             This fund was established to address priority constraints to market
            access that arise because of unforeseen events; market conditions in
            emerging markets are often less predictable than in more developed
            countries. It allows responsiveness to time-sensitive marketing
            problems or opportunities, such as a change in an import regime or
            the removal of a trade embargo; an unexpected or unusual change in
            the political or financial situation in a country; or a significant
            change in crop conditions—any of which may have an immediate impact
            on the access of particular commodities or products to specific
            markets.

             This fund was established to address technical barriers to trade in
            emerging markets worldwide by providing technical assistance,
            training, and exchange of expertise. These include plant quarantine,
            animal health, food safety, and other technical barriers to U.S.
            exports based on unsound or incomplete scientific information.

             Funding priorities are principally those issues that are time
            sensitive and are strategic areas of longer term interest. Funding
            decisions are determined primarily through a review process that
            includes FAS and relevant regulatory agencies. The review is based
            upon the following criteria:

             The EMP is intended to complement, not supplant, the efforts of the
            U.S. private sector. Therefore, no private sector proposal will be
            considered without the element of cost-share from the participant
            and/or U.S. partners.

             There is no minimum or maximum amount of cost share. The degree of
            commitment to a proposed project represented by the amount and type
            of private funding are both used in determining which proposals will
            be approved. The type of cost share is also not specified, though
            some contributions are ineligible (

             below). Cost-share may be actual cash invested or professional time
            of staff assigned to the project. Proposals in which the private
            sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as
            staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost-share, will
            be given priority consideration.

             Cost-sharing is not required for proposals from federal, state, or

             After implementation of an EMP project for which CCC has agreed to
            provide funding, Recipients may submit claims for reimbursement of
            the expenses incurred to the extent CCC has agreed to pay for such
            costs. Reimbursement for approved project expenses is limited to 85
            percent of the amount specified in the project agreement. The
            Recipient may be reimbursed for the remaining 15 percent of the
            funds after the final performance report containing the information
            required by the agreement is submitted to and approved by FAS.

             Upon request, CCC may make advance payments to a Recipient against

            budget may be provided as an advance, either at one time or in
            incremental payments. Advances should be limited to the minimum
            amounts needed and requested as close as is administratively
            feasible to the actual time of disbursement by the Recipient.
            Reimbursement claims will be used to offset advances. Recipients
            shall deposit and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing
            accounts.

          A Recipient&apos;s contribution requirement is specified in the
          project agreement. If a Recipient fails to contribute the total
          specified in the agreement, the difference between the amount
          contributed and the total must be repaid to the CCC in U.S. dollars.
          If a Recipient is reimbursed by CCC for less than the amount of funds
          approved in the agreement, then the final cost share shall equal, on a
          percentage basis, the original ratio of private contributions to the
          authorized EMP funding level.

             The Recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing

            to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or
