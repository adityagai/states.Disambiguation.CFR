            households or their representatives that may be affected by
            implementation of the EBT system. Written commitments from the
            retail grocer community (including supermarket chains, independent
            retailers, and convenience stores) and participating financial
            institutions in the pilot area shall be provided along with other
            documentation that demonstrates the willingness to support the
            proposed EBT system within the pilot area and expanded system area.
            The State agency shall submit evidence of contacts with recipient
            organizations and others.

             The pilot and expansion schedule must be delineated in the State
            agency&apos;s approved implementation plan. As part of the plan, the
            State agency must indicate a suitable pilot area to serve as the
            basis of the 3-month analysis and reporting, however, expansion can
            occur simultaneously with pilot operations. Submission of an
            Advanced Planning Document Update to request FNS approval to
            implement and operate the EBT system in areas beyond the pilot area
            is only required in instances where there are substantial changes to
            the implementation plan. However, if significant problems arise
            during the pilot period or expansion, the Department can require the
            roll-out be suspended until such problems are resolved.

             State agencies may receive one hundred percent Federal funding for
            the costs they incur for switching and settling all SNAP interstate
            transactions. For purposes of this section, the term “switching”
            means the routing of an interstate transaction that consists of
            transmitting the details of a transaction electronically recorded
            through the use of an EBT card in one State to the issuer of the
            card that is in another State; and the term “settling” means
            movement, and reporting such movement, of funds from an EBT card
            issuer located in one State to a retail food store, or wholesale
            food concern, that is located in another State, to accomplish an
            interstate transaction. The total amount of one hundred percent
            funding available annually is limited to $500,000 nationwide. Once
            the $500,000 limitation is exceeded, Federal financial participation
            reverts to the standard fifty percent program reimbursement rate and
            procedure. To qualify for this funding, the State agency must:

             Each State agency is responsible for the timely and accurate
            issuance of benefits to certified eligible households, including EBT
            system compliance with the expedited service benefit delivery
            standard and the normal application processing standards, as
            prescribed by these regulations. Those households located in rural
            areas or comprised of elderly or disabled members who have
            difficulty reaching issuance offices, and households which do not
            reside in a permanent dwelling or of a fixed mailing address shall
            be given assistance in obtaining an EBT card. State agencies shall
            assist these households by arranging for the mailing of EBT cards to
            them, by assisting them in finding authorized representatives who
            can act on their behalf, or by using other appropriate means.

             All newly certified households, except those that are given
            expedited service, shall be given an opportunity to participate no
            later than 30 calendar days following the date the application was
            filed. An opportunity to participate consists of providing
            households with an active EBT card and PIN, and benefits that have
            been posted to the household&apos;s EBT account and are available
            for spending. State agencies, utilizing a centralized mailing
            system, must mail EBT cards and PINs, if applicable, in time to
            assure that the benefits can be spent after they are received but
            before the 30-day standard expires. A household has not been
            provided an opportunity to participate within the 30-day standard if
            the EBT card or PIN is mailed on the 29th or 30th day. For
            households entitled to expedited service, the State agency shall
            make benefits available to the household not later than the seventh
            calendar day following the date of application. State agencies which
            issue EBT cards by mail shall, at a minimum, use first class mail
            and sturdy nonforwarding envelopes or packages to send EBT cards to
            households.

            more benefits than the household is entitled to receive.

             A State agency shall make adjustments to an account to correct an
            auditable, out-of-balance settlement condition that occurs during
            the redemption process as a result of a system error. A system error
            is defined as an error resulting from a malfunction at any point in
            the redemption process: from the system host computer, to the
            switch, to the third party processors, to a store&apos;s host
            computer or POS device. These adjustments may occur 
            <PRTPAGE P='906' />
            after the availability date and may result in either a debit or
            credit to the household.

             The State agency must act on all requests for adjustments made by

            The State agency has 10 business days from the date the household
            notifies it of the error to investigate and reach a decision on an
            adjustment and move funds into the client account. This timeframe
            also applies if the State agency or entity other than the household
            discovers a system error that requires a credit adjustment to the
            household. Business days are defined as calendar days other than
            Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.

            balance within 48 hours of the request by the household, pending
            resolution of the fair hearing. If no request for a hearing is made
            within 10 days of the notice, the hold is released on the adjustment
            balance, and this amount is credited to the retailer&apos;s account.
            If there are insufficient funds available in the current month to

            and supermarkets shall, at a minimum, receive one terminal for every
            $11,000 in monthly redemption activity up to the number of lanes per
            store. All other food retailers shall receive one terminal for every
            $8,000 in monthly redemption activity up to the number of lanes per
            store. However, a State agency may utilize an alternative deployment
            formula that permits equipment deployment at higher levels than
            required by this paragraph up to the number of lanes in each store.
            The State agency shall review terminal deployment on a yearly basis
            and shall be authorized to remove excess terminals if actual
            redemption activity warrants a reduction.

             For newly authorized retailers, the State agency and retailer shall
            negotiate a mutually agreed level of terminal deployment up to the
            number of lanes per store. The State agency may 
            <PRTPAGE P='908' />
            consult with the appropriate FNS field office in order to determine
            the previous SNAP redemption activity that could be utilized in
            determining the initial number of terminals to deploy in newly
            authorized retailer firms. State agencies will also need to make
            accommodations for border stores that are deemed necessary for
            client access. To do so, State agencies must ensure that procedures
            are in place to process manual vouchers in instances when the system
            is down or for those retailers that do not have POS equipment.
            Redemption information shall remain confidential. Unauthorized
            release of redemption information is subject to penalties defined in

            data to the FNS regional office for review and comment. FNS shall
            monitor the accuracy of the Statewide estimated dollar value of
            benefits issued and the number of households and persons
            participating as reported on the Form FNS-388 report against the
            Statewide actual total participation as reported on succeeding Form

            participation totals attached to the March and September Form
            FNS-388 reports. The FNS accuracy standards for the issuance and
            participation estimates are that estimates for the current month be
            within (+) or (−) four (4) percent of actual levels, and the
            estimates for the previous month be within (+) or (−) two (2)
            percent of actual levels. State agencies shall explain any unusual
            circumstances that cause benefit issuance and/or participation data
            to not meet these accuracy standards. If a State agency fails to
            meet these accuracy standards, FNS shall notify the State agency and
            assist the State agency in revising its estimating procedures to
            improve its reporting.

             The State agency may impose a replacement fee by reducing the
            monthly allotment of the household receiving the replacement card;
            however, the fee may not exceed the cost to replace the card. If the
            State agency intends to collect the fee by reducing the monthly
            allotment, it must follow FNS reporting procedures for collecting
            program income. State agencies currently operating EBT systems must
            inform FNS of their proposed collection operations. State agencies
            in the process of developing an EBT system must include the
            procedure for collection of the fee in their system design document.
            All plans must specify how the State agency intends to account for
            card replacement fees and include identification of the replacement
            threshold, frequency, and circumstances in which the fee shall be
            applicable. State agencies may establish good cause policies that
            provide exception rules for cases where replacement card fees will
            not be collected.

             For leased line systems, 98 percent of EBT transactions shall be
            processed within 10 seconds or less and all EBT transactions shall
            be processed within 15 seconds. Leased line systems rent
            telecommunications carriers specifically to connect to the central
            authorizing computer. For dial-up systems, 95 percent of the EBT
            transactions shall be processed within 15 seconds or less and all
            EBT transactions shall be processed within 20 seconds or less.
            Dial-up systems utilize existing telecommunications lines to dial up
            and connect to the central computer at the time of the transaction.
            Processing response time shall be measured at the POS terminal from
            the time the `enter&apos; or `send&apos; key is pressed to the
            receipt and display of authorization or disapproval information.
            Third party processors, as defined in paragraph (h)(5) of this
            section, shall be required by the State agency to comply with the
            same processing response times required of the primary processor.
