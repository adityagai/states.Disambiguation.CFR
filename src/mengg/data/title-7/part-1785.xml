          This subpart B sets forth policies and procedures on the RUS cushion
          of creditpayments program. The cushion of credit payments program will
          be maintained only for insured loans evidenced by obligations of the
          Fund. A subaccount within the Fund is hereby established for purposes
          of promoting rural economic development. It shall be known as the
          “Rural Economic Development Subaccount.” The assets of the subaccount
          shall be obtained from crediting (on a monthly basis) a sum determined
          by multiplying the outstanding cushion of credit payments made after
          October 1, 1987, by the difference (converted on a monthly basis)
          between the average weighted interest rate paid on outstanding
          certificates of beneficial ownership issued by the Fund and the 5
          percent rate of interest provided to borrowers on cushion of credit
          payments, repayment of loans made pursuant to 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            Section 313 of
          </aref>
           the Act, and other sources as provided by law. This subaccount shall
          be used to provide grants or zero interest loans to borrowers under
          the Act for the purpose of promoting rural economic development.

          A cushion of credit account shall be automatically established by RUS
          for each borrower who makes a payment after October 1, 1987, in excess
          of amounts then due on an RUS note. Such account will bear interest at
          a rate of 5 percent per annum. All payments on RUS notes which are in
          excess of required payments and not otherwise designated shall be
          deposited in the borrowers&apos; respective cushion of credit
          accounts. Payments received in the month in which an installment is
          due will be applied to the installment due. However, if the regular
          installment payment is received at a later date in the month, the
          first payment received will be applied retroactively to a cushion of
          credit account and the second will be applied to the installment due.

             If a maturing installment on an RUS note or a note which has been
            guaranteed by RUS is not received by its due date, funds will be
            withdrawn from the borrower&apos;s cushion of credit account and
            applied as of the installment due date beginning with the oldest of
            such notes as follows: first, to current interest then due on all
            notes; second, to the accumulated interest due, if any, on all
            notes; and third, to the principal then due on all notes. In those
            instances where a borrower has prior to October 2, 1987, maintained
            an advance payment account with RUS, its cushion of credit account
            will be applied in accordance with the provisions of this section
            prior to using any balance remaining in its advance payment account
            to pay interest and principal installments on notes. Computations
            required under this section have been made by RUS as of October 2,
            1987; however, on or before May 25, 1989 any borrower may make a one
            time irrevocable election to have all such computations made as of
            April 5, 1989, by filing written notice to that effect with Robert
            D. Ruddy, Director, Fiscal Accounting Division, Rural Utilities
            Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.
