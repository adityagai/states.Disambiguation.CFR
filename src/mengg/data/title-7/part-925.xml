             The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each
            such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure
            sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during
            such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to
            approximately one fiscal period&apos;s expenses. At any time during
            or after a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of
            assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later
            findings by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be
            incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all grapes handled
            during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for
            the administration of the provisions of this part during the first
            part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is
            available from assessments in the current period&apos;s shipments,
            the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and
            may also borrow money for such purpose.
