            contract, if the insured does not file production reports as
            required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in
            the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except
            for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).

             Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH purposes
            the term does not include any year when the crop was not planted or
            when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable
            cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county to
            wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the
            policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar
            year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.

             The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing a
            minimum of four yields and will be updated each subsequent crop
            year. The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop
            years and may include actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted T
            or D-Yields. T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur
            in the database when there are less than four years of actual and/or
            assigned yields.

             If the producer&apos;s crop is destroyed or if it produces a low
            actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average
            yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to
            FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield
            adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic
            years. Premium rates for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for
            catastrophic years, may be based on the producer&apos;s APH average
            yield prior to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as
            determined appropriate by FCIC.

             Debt collection by salary offset is feasible if: the cost to the
            Government of collection by salary offset does not exceed the amount
            of the debt; there are no legal restrictions to the debt, such as
            the debtor being under the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court or the
            expiration of a statute of limitations; or, other such legal
            restrictions. The Debt Collection Act permits collections of debts
            by offset for claims that have not been outstanding for more than 10
            years.

            funds through negligence and other matters. The debt does not have

             FCIC may use salary offset against one of its employees who is
            indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency.
            Salary offset will not be initiated until after other servicing
            options available to the requesting agency have been utilized, and
            due process has been afforded to the FCIC employee. When salary
            offset is utilized, payment for the debt will be deducted from the
            employee&apos;s salary and sent directly to the creditor agency. Not
            more than fifteen percent (15%) of the employee&apos;s disposable
            salary can be offset in any one pay period, unless the employee
            agrees in writing to the deduction of a larger amount.

        <P>
          The employee may propose, in response to a notice of intent, a written
          agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. The
          proposed written agreement to repay the debt must be received by the
          FCIC official within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice of
          intent. The FCIC official will notify the employee whether the
          employee&apos;s proposed written agreement for repayment is
          acceptable. The FCIC official may accept a repayment agreement instead
          of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the FCIC
          official will balance the FCIC interest in collecting the debt against
          hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee
          has not disputed its existence or amount, the FCIC official will
          accept a repayment agreement, instead of offset, for good cause such
          as, if the employee establishes that offset would result in undue
          financial hardship, or would be against equity and good conscience.

          A debt will be collected in a lump-sum or in installments. Collection
          will be by lump-sum collection unless the employee is financially
          unable to pay in one lump-sum, or if the amount of the debt exceeds 15
          percent of the disposable pay for an ordinary pay period. In these
          cases, deduction will be by installments as set forth in

             Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than

            installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size
            of the debt and the employee&apos;s ability to pay. If possible, the
            installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to
            liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments
            of less than $25.00 per pay period, or $50.00 per month, will be
            accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

             FCIC will deny reinsurance to any insurer or will terminate any
            existing reinsurance agreement if any false or misleading statement
            is made in the financial statements or any other document submitted
            by the insurer in connection with its qualification for FCIC
            reinsurance.

             No policy issued by an insurer subsequent to revocation of a
            reinsurance agreement will be reinsured by FCIC. Policies in effect
            at the time of revocation will continue to be reinsured by FCIC for
            the balance of the crop year then in effect for the applicable crop.
            However, if materially false information is made to the Corporation
            and that information directly affects the ability of the Company to
            perform under the Agreement, or if the Company commits any
            fraudulent or criminal act in relation to the Standard Reinsurance
            Agreement or any policy reinsured under the Agreement, FCIC may
            require that the Company transfer the servicing and contractual
            right to all business in effect and reinsured by the Corporation to
            the Corporation.

          policyholder or a person with a substantial beneficial interest in a
          policyholder for at least 10 consecutive crop years. The most recent

             FCIC or the insurance provider will retain all records of
            policyholders for a period of not less than 3 years from the date of
            final action on a policy for the crop year, unless further
            maintenance of specific records is requested by FCIC. Final actions
            on insurance policies include conclusion of insurance events, such
            as the latest of termination of the policy, completion of loss
            adjustment, or satisfaction of claim.

             The statute of limitations for FCIC contract claims may permit

            Destruction of records prior to the expiration of the statute of
            limitations will not provide a defense to any action by FCIC against
            any private insurance company.

          The Reform Act requires FCIC to implement a crop insurance program
          that offers several levels of insurance coverage for producers. These
          levels of protection include catastrophic risk protection, and
          additional coverage insurance. This subpart provides notice of the
          availability of these crop insurance options and establishes
          provisions and requirements for implementation of the insurance
          provisions of the Reform Act.

            farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already

             If a producer planted a crop of economic significance in the
            preceding crop year, and does not intend to plant the same crop in
            the present crop year, the producer does not have to obtain
            insurance coverage or execute a waiver of any eligibility for
            emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop in the
            present crop year to comply with the linkage requirements. However,
            if the producer later decides to plant that crop, the producer will
            be unable to obtain insurance after the sales closing date and must
            execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss

            Tracking System, reinstatement will be effective at the beginning of
            the crop year for which the producer was listed on the Ineligible
            Tracking System and the person will be entitled to all applicable
            benefits under the policy.

            determination from the Director of the National Appeals division on
            the issue of whether the final agency determination is a matter of
            general applicability.
