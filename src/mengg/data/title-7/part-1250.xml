             Is a person who supplied or supplies laying hens, chicks, and/or
            started pullets to an egg farmer for the purpose of producing
            commercial eggs pursuant to an oral or written contractual argeement
            for the production of commercial eggs. Such person is deemed to be
            the owner of such laying hens unless it is established in writing,
            to the satisfaction of the Secretary or the Egg Board, that actual
            ownership of the laying hens is in some other party to the contract.
            In the event the party to an oral contract who supplied or supplies
            the laying hens cannot be readily identified by the Secretary or the
            Egg Board, the person who has immediate possession and control over
            the laying hens at the egg production facility shall be deemed to be
            the owner of such hens unless written notice is provided to the
            Secretary or the Egg Board, signed by the parties to said oral
            contract, clearly stating that the eggs are being produced under a
            contractual agreement and identifying the party (or parties) under
            said contract who is the owner of the hens.

          The Board is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds
          are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Board for its
          maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers
          and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this

          shall not exceed an amount of the projected total assessments to be
          collected by the Board for such fiscal period that the Secretary
          determines to be reasonable. The funds to cover such expenses shall be
          paid from assessments received pursuant to

          The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an
          organization shall be whether its egg producer membership consists of
          a substantial number of egg producers who produce a substantial volume
          of the applicable geographic area&apos;s commercial eggs to reasonably
          warrant its participation in the nomination of members for the Board
          or to request the issuance of an order. The Secretary shall certify
          any organization which he finds to be eligible under this section and
          his determination as to eligibility shall be final.
