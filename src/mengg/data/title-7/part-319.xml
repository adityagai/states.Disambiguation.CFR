             Persons who request changes to the import regulations contained in
            this part and who wish to import plants, plant parts, or plant
            products that are not allowed importation under the conditions of
            this part must file a request with the Animal and Plant Health
            Inspection Service (APHIS) in order for APHIS to consider whether
            the new commodity can be safely imported into the United States. The
            initial request can be formal (e.g., a letter) or informal (e.g.,
            made during a bilateral discussion between the United States and
            another country), and can be made by any person. Upon APHIS
            confirmation that granting a person&apos;s request would require
            amendments to the regulations in this part, the national plant
            protection organization of the country from which the commodity
            would be exported must provide APHIS with the information listed in
            paragraph (d) of this section before APHIS can proceed with its
            consideration of the request; requests that are not supported with
            this information in a timely manner will be considered incomplete
            and APHIS may not take further action on such requests until all
            required information is submitted.

            15 of each year, except for covers which have been used to contain

             The importation of certain taxa of plants for planting poses a risk
            of introducing quarantine pests into the United States. Therefore,
            the importation of these taxa is not authorized pending the
            completion of a pest risk analysis, except as provided in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

             There are two lists of taxa whose importation is not authorized
            pending pest risk analysis: A list of taxa of plants for planting
            that are quarantine pests, and a list of taxa of plants for planting
            that are hosts of quarantine pests. For taxa of plants for planting
            that have been determined to be quarantine pests, the list includes
            the names of the taxa. For taxa of plants for planting that are
            hosts of quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa,
            the foreign places from which the taxa&apos;s importation is not
            authorized, and the quarantine pests of concern.

             Any restricted article offered for importation into the United
            States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate of
            inspection. The phytosanitary certificate must identify the genus of
            the article it accompanies. When the regulations in this subpart
            place restrictions on individual species or cultivars within a
            genus, the phytosanitary certificate must also identify the species
            or cultivar of the article it accompanies. Otherwise, identification
            of the species is strongly preferred, but not required. Intergeneric
            and interspecific hybrids must be designated by placing the
            multiplication sign “x” between the names of the parent taxa. If the
            hybrid is named, the multiplication sign may instead be placed
            before the name of an intergeneric hybrid or before the epithet in
            the name of an interspecific hybrid. Phytosanitary certificates are
            not required for the following restricted articles:

             The government of the country in which the articles are produced
            must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before each
            growing season. The government of the country in which the articles

            <PRTPAGE P='255' />
            designated representative is required to pay in advance all
            estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement
            in overseeing the execution of paragraph (r)(3) of this section.
            These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in
            conducting the services enumerated in paragraph (r)(3) of this
            section and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share
            of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem
            expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors
            in performing these services. The government of the country in which
            the articles are produced or its designated representative is
            required to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s check with APHIS
            for the amount of the costs estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is
            not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement
            further requires the government of the country in which the articles
            are produced or its designated representative to deposit with APHIS
            a certified or cashier&apos;s check for the amount of the remaining
            costs, as determined by APHIS, before the services will be
            completed. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping
            season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the government
            of the country in which the articles are produced or its designated
            representative or held on account until needed.

             The government of Spain must enter into a trust fund agreement with
            APHIS before each growing season. The government of Spain or its
            designated representative is required to pay in advance all
            estimated costs that APHIS expects to 
            <PRTPAGE P='258' />
            incur through its involvement in overseeing the execution of
            paragraph (u) of this section. These costs will include
            administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services
            enumerated in paragraph (u) of this section and all salaries
            (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits),
            travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental
            expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing these services.
            The government of Spain or its designated representative is required
            to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s check with APHIS for the
            amount of the costs estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not
            sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement
            further requires the government of Spain or its designated
            representative to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier&apos;s
            check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS,
            before the services will be completed. After a final audit at the
            conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would
            be returned to the government of Spain or its designated
            representative or held on account until needed.

             The government of Israel must enter into a trust fund agreement
            with APHIS before each growing season. The government of Israel or
            its designated representative is required to pay in advance all
            estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement
            in overseeing the execution of paragraph (v) of this section. These
            costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting
            the services enumerated in paragraph (v) of this section and all
            salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee
            benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other
            incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing these
            services. The government of Israel or its designated representative
            is required to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s check with
            APHIS for the amount of the costs estimated by APHIS. If the deposit
            is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement
            further requires the government of Israel or its designated
            representative to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier&apos;s
            check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS,
            before the services will be completed. After a final audit at the
            conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would
            be returned to the government of Israel or its designated
            representative or held on account until needed.

             Participants must establish a pest management program for all
            approved production, packing, and export facilities. Pest management
            programs must include field or facility scouting, monitoring, and
            control of target pests, and must be monitored and approved by the
            NPPO of Costa Rica. APHIS may visit sites to inspect and monitor the
            pest management program. Each approved facility must have a trained,
            dedicated person to supervise the pest management program. Records
            of pest management activities must be maintained and made available
            to the NPPO of Costa Rica and APHIS upon request.

             The Government of Costa Rica must enter into a trust fund agreement
            with APHIS before each growing season. The Government of Costa Rica
            or its designated representative is required to pay in advance all
            estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement
            in overseeing the execution of paragraph (y) of this section. These
            costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting
            the services enumerated in paragraph (y) of this section and all
            salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee
            benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other
            incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing these
            services. The Government of Costa Rica or its designated
            representative is required to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s
            check with APHIS 
            <PRTPAGE P='262' />
            for the amount of the costs estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is
            not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement
            further requires the Government of Costa Rica or its designated
            representative to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier&apos;s
            check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS,
            before the services will be completed. After a final audit at the
            conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would
            be returned to the Government of Costa Rica or its designated
            representative or held on account until needed.

             If an inspector determines that any article subject to the

            increase therefrom, is being grown at an unauthorized site, the
            inspector may file an emergency action notification (PPQ form 523)
            with the owner of the article or the person who owns or is in
            possession of the site on which the article is being grown. The
            person named in the form 523 must, within the time specified in form
            523, sign a postentry quarantine growing agreement, destroy, ship to
            a point outside the United States, move to an authorized postentry
            quarantine site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the
            article, the increase therefrom, or any portion of the article or
            the increase therefrom, as prescribed by an inspector to prevent the
            introduction of quarantine pests into the United States. In choosing
            which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action,
            the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by
            the quarantine pest(s) associated with the kind of article
            (including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials
            for the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at
            the site in relation to the pest&apos;s survival, and the
            availability of treatment facilities.

             If an inspector determines that any article, or any increase
            therefrom, grown at a site specified in an authorized postentry
            quarantine growing agreement is being grown contrary to the
            provisions of this section, including in numbers greater than the
            number approved by the postentry quarantine growing agreement, or in
            a manner that otherwise presents a risk of introducing quarantine
            pests into the United States, the inspector shall issue an emergency
            action notification (PPQ form 523) to the person who signed the
            postentry quarantine growing agreement. That person shall be
            responsible for carrying out all actions specified in the emergency
            action notification. The emergency action notification may extend
            the time for which the articles and the increase therefrom must be
            grown under the postentry quarantine conditions specified in the
            authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement, or may require
            that the person named in the notification must destroy, ship to a
            point outside the United States, or apply treatments or other
            safeguards to the article, the increase therefrom, or any portion of
            the article or the increase therefrom, within the time specified in
            the emergency action notification. In choosing which action to order

            consider the degree of pest risk presented by the quarantine pest(s)
            associated with the kind of article (including increase therefrom),
            the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the

            pest&apos;s survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.

            notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the

            regulated articles is inaccurate, the regulated articles which are
            the subject of the certificate or other document shall be refused

            allowed access to the facility to monitor compliance with the
            requirements of the compliance agreement and of this subpart.
            Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the Administrator or

            compliance agreement and the reasons for cancellation of the
            compliance agreement shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as
            circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been

            within 10 days after receiving written notification of the
            cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons
            upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement

            agreement has been canceled requests a hearing, a hearing shall be
            held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the
            hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

            similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures
            taken in connection with the importation of the regulated article to
            mitigate the plant pest risk associated with the regulated article.
            For example, if the plant pest risk assessment for the highest
            ranked plant pest indicates a need for a mitigation measure that
            would result in the same reduction of risk for other plant pests
            ranked in the group, the other members need not be subjected to
            individual plant pest risk assessment.

             The requirements of this subpart, and any other requirements
            relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be
            compared with the individual plant pest risk assessments in order to
            determine whether particular conditions on the importation of the
            regulated article would reduce the plant pest risk to an
            insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the imposition of
            particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article
            could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and
            determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to
            implement or ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will
            implement rulemaking to allow importation of the requested regulated
            article under the conditions identified by the plant pest risk
            assessment process.

             The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, and
            notice given, that dangerous plant pests, including the so-called
            European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubn.), and also other
            dangerous insects, as well as plant diseases not heretofore widely
            prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States,
            exist, as to one or more of such pests, in Europe, Asia, Africa,
            Dominion of Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, and other
            foreign countries and localities, and may be introduced into this
            country through importations of the stalks or other parts of Indian
            corn or maize, broomcorn, and related plants.

            pests, in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central America, South America, and
            other foreign countries and localities, and may be introduced into
            this country through importations of seed or paddy rice, rice straw,
            and rice hulls, and (2) that the unrestricted importation of seed or
            paddy rice from the Republic of Mexico and of rice straw and rice
            hulls from all foreign countries and localities may result in the
            entry into the United States of the injurious plant diseases

            States of seed or paddy rice from all foreign locations except the
            Republic of Mexico and to restrict the importation of seed or paddy
            rice, rice straw, and rice hulls from the Republic of Mexico and all

             The Administrator determined, and announced in the notice referred
            to in the previous paragraph, that, based on the information
            available, the application of one or more of the designated
            phytosanitary measures described in paragraph (b) of this section is
            sufficient to mitigate the risk that plant pests or noxious weeds
            could be introduced into or disseminated within the United States
            via the imported fruit or vegetable. In order for the Administrator
            to make the determination described in this paragraph, he or she
            must conclude based on the information presented in the risk
            analysis for the fruit or vegetable that the risk posed by each
            quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable in the
            country or other region of origin is mitigated by one or more of the

          As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables
          may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or
          vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or
          pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the
          area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit
          or vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if
          the area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack
          the fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the
          remaining quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is
          mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the
          regulations in this subpart.

            vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a

            or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the
            packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables
            are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during
            transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or
            containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins
            during transit to the port and subsequent export to the United
            States. These safeguards described in this section must be intact
            upon arrival in the United States.

          If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting
          country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or
          vegetables and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant
          protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private
          export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter
          into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time
          the fruits or vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO
          of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in
          advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing
          inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include
          administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all
          salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee
          benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other
          incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services.
          The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region
          or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s
          check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS.
          The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not
          sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the
          exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS,
          before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier&apos;s
          check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS.
          After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any 
          <PRTPAGE P='309' />
          overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting
          country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

             Preclearance inspection will be conducted in Chile under the
            direction of inspectors. An inspection unit will consist of a lot or
            consignment from which a statistical sample is drawn and examined.
            An inspection unit may represent multiple grower lots from different
            packing sheds. Apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, or plums in
            any inspection unit may be shipped to the United Sates only if the
            inspection unit passes inspection as follows:

             Consignments of apricots, nectarines, peaches, plumcot, and plums
            will be individually evaluated regarding the rates of infestation of
            inspection units of these articles presented for preclearance. The
            inspection program for an article will be terminated when
            inspections establish that the rate of infestation of inspection
            units of the article by pests listed in paragraph (f) of this
            section exceeds 20 percent calculated on any consecutive 14 days of
            actual inspections (not counting days on which inspections are not
            conducted). Termination of the inspection program for an article
            will require mandatory treatment in Chile, prior to shipment to the
            United States, of consignments of the article for the remainder of
            that shipping season. If a preclearance inspection program is
            terminated with Chile, precleared fruit in transit to the United
            States at the time of termination will be spot-checked by inspectors
            upon arrival in the United States for evidence of plant pests
            referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.

             Beginning at least 1 year before harvest begins and continuing
            through the completion of harvest, fruit fly traps were maintained
            in the field where the papayas were grown. The traps were placed at
            a rate of 1 trap per hectare and were checked for fruit flies at
            least once weekly by plant health officials of the NPPO. Fifty
            percent of the traps were of the McPhail type and 
            <PRTPAGE P='324' />
            50 percent of the traps were of the Jackson type. The NPPO kept
            records of fruit fly finds for each trap, updated the records each
            time the traps were checked, and made the records available to APHIS
            inspectors upon request. The records were maintained for at least 1
            year.

             In Colombia, Ecuador, or the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, if
            the average McPhail trap catch was greater than seven South American
            fruit flies (
            <E T='03'>
              Anastrepha fraterculus
            </E>
            ) per trap per week, measures were taken to control the South
            American fruit fly population in the production area. If the average
            McPhail fruit fly trap catch exceeds 14 South American fruit flies
            per trap per week, importations of papayas from that production area
            must be halted until the rate of capture drops to an average of 7 or
            fewer South American fruit flies per trap per week.

             Capture of a single Medfly in a registered greenhouse will
            immediately result in cancellation of exports from that greenhouse
            until the source of the infestation is determined, the Medfly
            infestation has been eradicated, and measures are taken to preclude
            any future infestation. Capture of a single Medfly within 200 meters
            of a registered greenhouse will necessitate increasing trap density
            in order to determine whether there is a reproducing population in
            the area. Six additional traps must be placed within a radius of 200
            meters surrounding the trap where the Medfly was captured. Capture
            of two Medflies within 200 meters of a registered greenhouse and
            within a 1-month time period will necessitate Malathion bait sprays
            in the area every 7 to 10 days for 60 days to ensure eradication;

            will necessitate increased trap density in order to determine
            whether there is a reproducing population in the area. Capture of

             In areas where citrus is produced for export to the United States,

            to harvest at a rate mutually agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of
            Peru. If fruit fly trapping levels at a production site exceed the
            thresholds established by APHIS and the NPPO of Peru, exports from
            that production site will be suspended until APHIS and the NPPO of
            Peru conclude that fruit fly population levels have been reduced to
            an acceptable limit. Fruit fly traps are monitored weekly;
            therefore, reinstatements of production sites will be evaluated on a
            weekly basis.

             Baby squash and baby courgettes must be packed within 24 hours of

            host material may be discarded within 50 meters of the entry door of

            squash or baby courgettes must be packed in insect-proof cartons for

            may only accept baby squash or baby courgettes from approved
            greenhouses. These safeguards must remain intact until the arrival

             The eggplant must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a
            pest-exclusionary packinghouse. While packing the eggplant for
            export to the continental United States, the packinghouse may only
            accept eggplant from approved pest-exclusionary structures. No shade
            trees are permitted within 10 meters of the entry door of the
            packinghouse, and no fruit fly host plants are permitted within 50
            meters of the entry door of the packinghouse. The eggplant must be
            safeguarded by a pest-proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in
            transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. Packinghouse
            procedures must include culling of any visibly damaged, overripe, or
            infested eggplant. The eggplant must be packed in either individual
            insect-proof cartons or boxes labeled with the specific place of
            origin or non-insect-proof cartons or boxes that are covered by
            insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins. Covered non-insect-proof
            cartons or boxes must be placed in shipping containers that have
            identification labels indicating the specific place of origin. These
            safeguards must remain intact until the arrival of the eggplant in
            the continental United States or the consignment will not be allowed
            to enter the continental United States.

             The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a
            pest-exclusionary packinghouse. During the time the packinghouse is
            in use for exporting tomatoes to the United States, the packinghouse
            may only accept tomatoes from registered pest-exclusionary
            structures. A random sample of fruit per lot, as determined by the
            NPPO of the Republic of Korea and agreed to by APHIS, must be
            inspected for external pests and the fruit must be cut to reveal
            internal pests. Each sample must be of sufficient size in order to
            detect pest infestations. Any damaged, diseased, or infested fruit
            should be removed and separated from the commodity destined for
            export. The tomatoes must be safeguarded by an insect-proof mesh,
            screen, or plastic tarpaulin while in transit from the production
            site to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. The tomatoes
            must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered
            with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, for transit to the
            United States. These safeguards must remain intact until the arrival
            of the tomatoes in the United States or the consignment will not be
            allowed to enter the United States.

            days prior to harvest, random samples of fruit must be collected
            from each registered production site under the direction of the NPPO
            of Chile. These samples must undergo a pest detection and evaluation
            method as follows: The fruit must be washed using a flushing method,
            placed in a 20- mesh sieve on top of a 200-mesh sieve, sprinkled
            with a liquid soap and water solution, washed with water at high

            then be repeated. The contents of the 200-mesh sieve must then be

            will be valid for one harvest season only. The NPPO of Chile will

            days prior to harvest, random samples of fruit must be collected
            from each registered production site under the direction of the NPPO
            of Chile. These samples must undergo a pest detection and evaluation
            method as follows: The fruit must be washed using a flushing method,
            placed in a 20-mesh sieve on top of a 200-mesh sieve, sprinkled with
            a liquid soap and water solution, washed with water at high

            then be repeated. The contents of the 200-mesh sieve must then be
            placed on a petri dish and analyzed for the presence of live

            will be valid for one harvest season only. The NPPO of Chile will

             If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment,
            reexportation, or other action with regard to imported cut flowers
            that are found to be infested with injurious plant pests or infected
            with diseases, the inspector will provide an emergency action
            notification (PPQ Form 523) to the importer, owner, or agent or
            representative of the importer or owner of the cut flowers. The
            importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer or owner
            must, within the time specified in the PPQ Form 523 and at his or
            her own expense, destroy the cut flowers, ship them to a point
            outside the United States, move them to an authorized site, and/or
            apply treatments, clean, or apply other safeguards to the cut
            flowers as prescribed by the inspector on the PPQ Form 523. Further,
            if the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer
            or owner fails to follow the conditions on PPQ Form 523 by the time
            specified on the form, APHIS will arrange for destruction of the cut
            flowers, and the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the
            importer or owner will be responsible for all costs incurred. Cut
            flowers that have been cleaned or treated must be made available for
            further inspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of the
            inspector at any time and place indicated by the inspector before
            the requirements of this subpart will have been met. Neither the
            Department of Agriculture nor the inspector may be held responsible
            for any adverse effects of treatment on imported cut flowers.

            writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose permit
            has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Deputy
            Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving the written

            grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the
            decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict
            as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such
