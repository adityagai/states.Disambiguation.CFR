             Each person who first handles avocados shall, with respect to the
            avocados so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such
            person&apos;s pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary
            finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee
            during each fiscal year. Each such person&apos;s share of such
            expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of
            avocados handled by him as the first handler thereof during the
            applicable fiscal year, and the total quantity of avocados so
            handled by all persons during the same fiscal year. The payment of
            assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may
            be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect
            irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended
            or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay his assessment
            within the time prescribed by the committee, the unpaid assessment
            may be subject to an interest charge at rates prescribed by the
            committee with the approval of the Secretary.

             The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment per 55-pounds of
            fruit or equivalent in any container or in bulk, to be paid by each
            such handler. At any time during or after a fiscal year, the
            Secretary may increase the rate of assessment, in order to secure
            sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary
            relative to the expense which may be incurred. Such increase shall
            be applied to all fruit handled during the applicable fiscal year.
            In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions
            of this part, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in
            advance, or borrow money on an emergency short-term basis. The
            authority of the committee to borrow money is subject to approval of
            the Secretary and may be used only to meet financial obligations as
            the obligations occur or to allow the committee to adjust its
            reserve funds to meet such obligations.
