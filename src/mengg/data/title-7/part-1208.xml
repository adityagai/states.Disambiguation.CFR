             At least once every five years, but not more frequently than once
            every three years, the Council will review the geographic
            distribution of United States production of processed raspberries
            and the quantity and source of processed raspberry imports. The
            review will be conducted through an audit of State crop production
            figures and Council assessment receipts. If warranted, the Council
            will recommend to the Secretary that membership on the Council be
            altered to reflect any changes in geographic distribution of
            domestic raspberry production for processing and the quantity of
            imports. If the level of imports increases or decreases, importer
            members and alternates may be added or reduced on the Council,
            subject to recommendation by the Council and approval of the
            Secretary. However, the foreign producer seats will remain the same
            regardless of the volume of imports from importing countries.

             For those States that have a State raspberry commission or State
            marketing order, the State raspberry commission or committee will
            nominate producers and their alternates to serve. The State
            raspberry commission or committee nominations will be sent to the
            Council and placed on a ballot which will then be sent to producers
            in the Region for a vote. The nominee for member will have received
            the highest number of votes cast. The person with the second highest
            number of votes cast will be the nominee for alternate. The persons
            with the third and fourth place highest number of votes cast will be
            designated as additional nominees for consideration by the
            Secretary. Once the Council has received all of the nominations from
            commissions or committees, the information will be submitted to the
            Secretary for appointment. Nominations for the initial Council will
            be handled by the Department. Subsequent nominations will be handled
            by the Council staff and shall be submitted to the Secretary not
            less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the term of office; or

          Council members and alternates will serve for a term of three years
          and be able to serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. A Council
          member may serve as an alternate during the years the member is
          ineligible for a member position. When the Council is first
          established, four producer members, two importers, one of the two
          foreign producers, and the at-large member and their respective
          alternates will be assigned initial terms of three years. The
          remaining three producer members, one importer member, and the second
          foreign producer and their alternates will serve an initial term of
          two years. Members serving an initial term of two years will be
          eligible to serve a second term of three years. Thereafter, each of
          these positions will carry a full three-year term. Council nominations
          and appointments will take place in two out of every three years.
          Council members shall serve during the term of office for which they
          are appointed and have qualified, and until their successors are
          appointed and have qualified. Each term of office will end on December
          31, with new terms of office beginning on January 1.

            less than 20,000 pounds for the fiscal year for which the exemption
            is claimed. Any importer who imports less than 20,000 pounds of

            exceed 20,000 pounds, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is
            claimed. If a producer or importer determines at the end of the year
            that they did not meet the 20,000 pounds minimum, the producer or
            importer can request a reimbursement on the assessments paid to the
            Council by 60 days of the last day of the year. If, after a person

            this section, and the person no longer meets the requirements of
            paragraph of this section for an exemption, the person shall file a

            subsequent year on all raspberries for processing produced or
            processed raspberries imported by such persons during the year for
            which the person claimed the exemption.
