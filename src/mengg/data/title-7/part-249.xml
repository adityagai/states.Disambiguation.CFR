            section. If the State agency administers both the SFMNP and the
            FMNP, one consolidated State Plan may be submitted for both
            programs, in accordance with guidance provided by FNS. The State
            Plan must be signed by the State-designated official responsible for
            ensuring that the Program is operated in accordance with the State
            Plan. FNS will provide written approval or denial of a completed
            State Plan or amendment within 30 days of receipt. Portions of the
            State Plan that do not change annually need not be resubmitted.
            However, the State agency shall provide the title of the sections
            that remain unchanged, as well as the year of the last Plan in which
            the sections were submitted. At a minimum, the Plan must include the
            following items, which must include sufficient detail to demonstrate
            the State agency&apos;s ability to meet the requirements of the
            SFMNP:

          In selecting new State agencies, FNS will use objective criteria to
          rank and approve State plans submitted in accordance with 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            </subref>
          </aref>
          . In making this ranking, FNS will consider the amount of funds
          necessary to operate the SFMNP successfully in the State compared with
          other States and with the total amount of funds available to the
          SFMNP, the number of participants estimated to be served, and the
          projected benefit level. Approval of a State Plan does not equate to
          an obligation on the part of FNS to fund the SFMNP within that State.

            operations and may satisfy nutrition education requirements through
            coordination with other agencies within the State. State agencies
            wishing to coordinate nutrition education with another State agency
            or organization must enter into a written cooperative agreement with
            such agencies to offer nutrition education relevant to the use and
            nutritional value of foods available to SFMNP participants. In cases
            where SFMNP participants are receiving relevant nutrition education
            from an agency other than the administering State agency, the
            provision of nutrition education is an allowable administrative cost
            under the SFMNP.

            authorization of farmers, farmers&apos; markets, roadside stands,
            and/or CSA programs. The State agency is responsible for the fiscal
            management of and accountability for SFMNP-related activities for
            farmers, farmers&apos; markets, roadside stands, and CSA programs.
            Each State agency may decide whether to authorize individual farmers
            and farmers&apos; markets separately, or to authorize only
            farmers&apos; markets. In addition, each State agency may decide
            whether to authorize roadside stands and/or CSA programs. The State
            agency may authorize a farmer for participation in a farmers&apos;
            market, a roadside stand, and/or CSA program simultaneously. All
            contracts or agreements entered into by the State agency for 
            <PRTPAGE P='515' />
            the management or operation of farmers, farmers&apos; markets,

             Food costs are the costs of eligible foods provided to SFMNP
            participants. Administrative costs are the costs associated with
            providing SFMNP benefits and services to participants and generally
            administering the SFMNP. Specific examples of allowable
            administrative costs are listed in paragraph (b) of this section. A
            State agency may use up to 10 percent of its total Federal SFMNP
            grant to cover administrative costs. Any costs incurred for food
            and/or administration above the Federal grant level will be the
            State agency&apos;s responsibility.

             Upon termination of a grant, the affected agency may not incur new
            obligations after the effective date of the disqualification, and
            must cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. FNS will
            allow full credit to the State agency for the Federal share of the
            noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the State agency
            prior to disqualification, and the State agency shall do the same
            for farmers, farmers&apos; markets, roadside stands, and/or CSA

            after fully considering any recommended disallowances resulting from
            an audit which may be conducted later.

            agencies carry out the purposes and provisions of this part, the
            State Plan, and the written agreement with FNS. As a part of the
            evaluation procedure, FNS will review audits to ensure that the
            SFMNP has been included in audit examinations at a reasonable
            frequency. These evaluations shall also include reviews of selected
            local agencies, and on-site reviews of selected farmers,
            farmers&apos; markets, roadside stands, and community supported
            agriculture programs. These evaluations will measure the State
            agency&apos;s progress toward meeting the objectives outlined in its
            State Plan and the State agency&apos;s compliance with these
            regulations.
