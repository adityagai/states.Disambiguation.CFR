             If RUS determines that HWWS loans may be serviced by CSC, then the
            grant recipient will enter into an agreement with the Centralized
            Servicing Center for servicing all HWWS loans made from the
            revolving loan fund. All HWWS loan payments will be received by and
            processed at the Centralized Servicing Center. The grant recipient
            will be charged a fee for this service, and such fee should be
            included in the projected financial statements and work plan
            submitted as part of the grant application. This fee may be
            reimbursed as an administrative expense as provided in

             If RUS determines that CSC is not able to service HWWS loans, then
            the grant recipient shall be responsible for servicing, or causing
            to be serviced, all HWWS loans. Servicing will include preparing
            loan agreements, processing loan payments, reviewing financial
            statements and debt reserves balances, and other responsibilities
            such as enforcement of loan terms. Loan servicing will be in
            accordance with the work plan RUS approved when the grant was
            awarded. It will continue as long as any loan made in whole or in
            part with RUS grant funds is outstanding.

             A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a
            reserve for bad debts. Reserves should be accumulated over a period
            of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected
            losses, considering the quality of the grant recipient&apos;s
            portfolio of loans. Unless the grant recipient provides loss and
            delinquency records that, in the opinion of RUS, justifies different
            amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans
            must be accumulated over three years and then maintained as set
            forth in the grant agreement.
