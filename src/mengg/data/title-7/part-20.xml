             A transaction entered into between a reporting exporter and a
            foreign buyer. The transaction must be represented by a written
            document evidencing that (1) the exporter agrees to export the
            commodity, (2) the foreign buyer agrees to receive the commodity,
            (3) a fixed price or an agreed upon mechanism by which such a price
            can be determined is established, and (4) payment will be made to or
            for the account of the reporting exporter by or on the behalf of the
            foreign buyer for delivery of the commodity. The quantity of
            “outstanding export sale” means the quantity not yet exported under
            an export sale. The terms of delivery specified in the written
            agreement, such as FAS vessel, FOB vessel, C&amp;F, CIF, etc., do
            not determine whether a transaction is an export sale which must be
            reported. A transaction which otherwise meets this definition and is
            subject to the posting of an exporter performance bond or letter of
            credit from the foreign buyer is included in this definition and
            such a transaction shall be reported under these regulations.
            However, a transaction which becomes operative only upon the
            imposition of export controls is excluded from this definition of
            “export sale” and such a transaction shall not be reported under
            these regulations.

             A person whose place of doing business with respect to the
            transaction is outside the United States. Foreign buyer or foreign
            seller includes a person who maintains a place of doing business
            outside the United States even though the transaction is concluded
            in the United States by his agent who has a place of business in the
            United States or by his employee who does not maintain a place of
            doing business in the United States. (If such employee maintains a
            place of doing business in the United States with respect to the
            transaction, the resulting contract is construed to be a domestic
            sale.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all foreign governments,
            agencies and instrumentalities are considered foreign buyers or
            foreign sellers even though transactions are concluded by their
            employees in the United States or they maintain a place of business
            with respect to the transaction in the United States.
