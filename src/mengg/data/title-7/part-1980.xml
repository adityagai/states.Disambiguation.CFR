             The basic objective of the guaranteed RH loan program is to assist
            eligible households in obtaining adequate but modest, decent, safe,
            and sanitary dwellings and related facilities for their own use in
            rural areas by guaranteeing sound RH loans which otherwise would not
            be made without a guarantee. Guarantees issued under this subpart
            are limited to loans to applicants with incomes that do not exceed
            income limits as provided in exhibit C of FmHA Instruction 1980-D
            (available in any RHS office).

             Loan guarantees and services provided under this subpart are
            subject to various civil rights statutes. Assistance shall not be
            denied to any person or applicant based on race, sex, national
            origin, color, familial status, religion, age, or physical or mental
            disability (the applicant must possess the capacity to enter into a
            legal contract for services). The Consumer Protection Act provides
            that the applicant may not be denied assistance based on receipt of
            income from public assistance or because the applicant has, in good
            faith, exercised any right provided under the Act.

            Disabled person.
          </E>
           A person who is unable to engage in any substantially gainful
          activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental
          impairment expected to result in death or which has lasted or is
          expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
          The disability is expected to be of long or indefinite duration;
          substantially impede the person&apos;s ability to live independently;
          and is of such a nature that the person&apos;s ability to live
          independently could be improved by more suitable housing conditions.
          In the case of an individual who has attained the age of 55 and is
          blind, disability is defined as inability by reason of such blindness
          to engage in substantially gainful activity requiring skills or
          abilities comparable to those of any gainful activity in which the
          individual has previously engaged with some regularity over a
          substantial period of time. Receipt of veteran&apos;s benefits for
          disability, whether service-oriented or otherwise, does not
          automatically establish disability. A disabled person also includes a
          person with a developmental disability. A developmental disability
          means a severe, chronic disability of a person which:

             The loan note guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the
            full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable
            except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the Lender has actual
            knowledge at the time it becomes such Lender or which the Lender
            participates in or condones. Misrepresentation includes negligent
            misrepresentation. A note which provides for the payment of interest
            on interest shall not be guaranteed. Any guarantee or assignment of
            a guarantee attached to or relating to a note which provides for the
            payment of interest on interest is void. Notwithstanding the
            prohibition of interest on interest, interest may be capitalized in
            connection with reamortization over the remaining term with written
            concurrence of RHS. The loan note guarantee will be unenforceable to
            the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws,
            negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security
            regardless of the time at which RHS acquires knowledge of the
            foregoing. Negligent servicing is defined as servicing that is
            inconsistent with this subpart and includes the failure to perform
            those services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in
            servicing its own loan portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed.
            The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also
            not acting in a timely manner or acting contrary to the manner in
            which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan
            maturity or until a final loss is paid. Any losses occasioned will
            be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes
            other than those authorized in this subpart. When the lender
            conducts liquidation in an expeditious manner, in accordance with
            the provisions of 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 1980.374 of
            </aref>
             this subpart, the loan note guarantee shall cover interest until
            the claim is paid within the limit of the guarantee.

             Loans guaranteed under this subpart may be sold only to entities

            section or directly to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Such entities are
            referred to as a Lender and are to be treated as a Lender for all
            purposes under this subpart. The selling Lender shall provide the
            original loan note guarantee to the purchasing Lender. The selling
            Lender is responsible for reporting the sale of any loan to RHS
            within 30 days using a reporting form provided by RHS. The
            purchasing Lender must execute a Lender Agreement or have a valid
            Lender Agreement on file with RHS. The purchasing Lender shall

            loan note guarantee. Any necessary or convenient assignments or

            necessary or convenient to perfect or record such transaction are
            the responsibility of the purchasing Lender. The purchasing Lender

            with, all covenants, agreements, terms, and conditions contained in
            any note, security instrument, loan note guarantee, and of any

            continued to hold the loan.

            revoke the eligible Lender status of any Lender who fails to comply
            with requirements of paragraph (b) or (e) of this section. Status
            may also be revoked if the Lender violates the terms of the Lender
            Agreement, fails to properly service any guaranteed loan, or fails
            to adequately protect the interests of the Lender and the
            Government. If the Lender is determined to be no longer eligible,
            the Lender will continue to service any outstanding loans guaranteed
            under this subpart which are held by the Lender or RHS may require
            the Lender to transfer the servicing of the loan. In addition to
            revocation of eligible Lender status, the Lender may be debarred by
            RHS.

          The purpose of a loan guaranteed under this subpart must be to acquire
          a completed dwelling and related facilities to be used by the
          applicant as a primary residence. The loan may be to purchase a new
          dwelling or an existing dwelling. The guaranteed loan may be for “take
          out” financing for a loan to construct a new dwelling or improve an
          existing dwelling when the construction financing is arranged in
          connection with the loan package. The loan may include funds for the
          purchase and installation of necessary appliances, energy saving
          measures, and storm cellars. Incidental expenses for tax monitoring
          services, architectural, appraisal, survey, environmental, and other

           apply to loan guarantees made under this subpart. Lenders and
          applicants must cooperate with RHS in the completion of these
          requirements. Lenders must become familiar with these requirements so
          that they can advise applicants and reduce the probability of
          unacceptable applications being submitted to RHS. RHS may require that
          Lenders and/or applicants obtain information for completing

          will utilize adequate, reliable information in completion of

          limited to, the State Natural Resource Management Guide (available in

          within the Agency as well as other agencies and organizations to

             In considering whether the applicant has adequate repayment
            ability, the Lender must calculate a total debt ratio. The
            applicant&apos;s total debt ratio is calculated by dividing the
            applicant&apos;s monthly obligations by gross monthly income.

            shorter term debts that are considered to have a significant impact

             An applicant&apos;s qualifying income may be different than the
            “adjusted annual income” which is used to determine program
            eligibility. In considering qualifying income, the Lender must
            determine whether there is a historical basis to conclude that the
            income is likely to continue. Typically, income of less than 24
            months duration should not be included in qualifying income. If the
            applicant is obligated to pay child care costs, the amount of any
            Federal tax credit for which the applicant is eligible may be added
            to the applicant&apos;s qualifying income.

            having a history over the previous 12 month period of devoting a
            similar percentage of income to housing expense to that of the

            will be continued. An outstanding judgment obtained by the United
            States in a Federal court (other than the United States Tax Court),
            which has been recorded, shall cause the applicant to be ineligible
            to receive a loan guarantee until the judgment is paid in full or
            otherwise satisfied. RHS loan guarantee funds may not be used to
            satisfy the judgment. If the judgment remains unsatisfied or if the
            applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt and is unable to resolve
            the delinquency, the Lender will reject the applicant.

            time the loan is assumed and title to the property is transferred.

          RHS encourages Lenders to provide borrowers with the maximum
          opportunity to become successful homeowners. Lenders should provide
          sufficient servicing and counseling to meet the objectives of the
          loan. Loan servicing should be approached as a preventive action
          rather than a curative action. Prompt followup by the Lender on
          delinquent payments and early recognition and solution of problems are
          
          <PRTPAGE P='249' />
          keys to resolving many delinquent loan cases. The Lender shall perform
          those services which a reasonable and prudent Lender would perform in
          servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed.

          Default occurs when the borrower fails to perform under any covenant
          of the mortgage or Deed of Trust and the failure continues for 30
          days. The Lender will negotiate in good faith in an attempt to resolve
          any problem. The borrower must be given a reasonable opportunity to
          bring the account current before any foreclosure proceedings are

          Protective advances must constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to
          the Lender and be secured by the security instrument. Protective
          advances are advances made for expenses of an emergency nature
          necessary to preserve or protect the physical security. Attorney fees
          are not a protective advance. The Lender will not make protective
          advances in lieu of an additional loan. In order to assure that a
          protective advance over $500 will be included in the loss payment,
          Lenders are encouraged to obtain prior RHS approval.

             As specified in this section, the Lender may reduce the interest
            rate to a level at or below the maximum allowable interest rate and
            extend the term of the loan up to 40 years from the date of loan
            modification (“extended-term loan modification”) and, if necessary,
            advance funds on behalf of a borrower to satisfy the borrower&apos;s
            arrearage, pay legal fees and foreclosure costs related to a
            cancelled foreclosure action, and reduce principal (“mortgage
            recovery advance”) (collectively, “special loan servicing”). Upon
            request, RHS will reimburse the Lender for eligible mortgage
            recovery advances under the partial loss claim procedures of this
            section. Lenders must receive written approval from RHS prior to
            servicing a borrower&apos;s account with special loan servicing. The
            Lender must submit a servicing plan to RHS pursuant to

            divided by the borrower&apos;s gross monthly income. The servicing
            options in this section shall be used in the order established in
            paragraph (c) of this section to bring the borrower&apos;s mortgage
            payment to income ratio as close as possible to, but not less than,
            31 percent. Prior to servicing a borrower&apos;s account with
            special loan servicing, the Lender must verify the borrower&apos;s
            income. For borrowers who are employed by a private or public
            organization, the Lender shall verify the borrower&apos;s income by
            examining documents such as the borrower&apos;s current pay stub and
            most recent Internal Revenue Service Form W-2. For borrowers who are
            self-employed, the Lender shall verify the borrower&apos;s income by
            examining documents such as the borrower&apos;s profit and loss
            statements (for the year to date and the previous year) and the
            borrower&apos;s signed tax return for the previous year.

             A special forbearance plan is structured so that it leads to a

            amount sufficient to repay the arrearage over time, or (if the
            borrower is at least three months delinquent) through resumption of
            normal payments for a period (generally three or more months)
            followed by a 
            <PRTPAGE P='251' />
            loan modification. The maximum arrearage under a special forbearance
            plan must never exceed the equivalent of 12 months of PITI.

             A loan modification is a permanent change in one or more of the
            terms of a loan that results in a payment the borrower can afford
            and allows the loan to be brought current. Loan modifications may
            include a reduction in the interest rate, even below the market rate
            if necessary; capitalization of all or a portion of the arrearage
            (PITI); and/or reamortization of the balance due. The term of the
            loan modification may not exceed 30 years from the date of the
            original loan. The terms of the SFHGLP loan note guarantee do not
            change. The loan note guarantee is in effect only for 30 years from
            the date of the original loan.

            recovery advance, the Lender must reduce the interest rate to the

            years from the date of loan modification. The Lender may reduce the
            interest rate further and/or extend the term of the loan for up to

            option, but the Lender shall not be required to do so before

             The borrower&apos;s total debt to income ratio following the
            special loan servicing must not exceed 55 percent. Total debt to
            income ratio is defined as the borrower&apos;s monthly mortgage
            payment plus all recurring monthly debt divided by the
            borrower&apos;s gross monthly income. Prior to servicing a
            borrower&apos;s account with special loan servicing, the Lender must
            verify the borrower&apos;s income and total debt. For borrowers who
            are employed by a private or public organization, the Lender shall
            verify the borrower&apos;s income by examining documents such as the
            borrower&apos;s current pay stub and most recent Internal Revenue
            Service Form W-2. For borrowers who are self-employed, the Lender
            shall verify the borrower&apos;s income by examining documents such
            as the borrower&apos;s profit and loss statements (for the year to
            date and the previous year) and the borrower&apos;s signed tax
            return for the previous year. The Lender shall verify the
            borrower&apos;s total debt by ordering and examining the
            borrower&apos;s credit report.

             The borrower must successfully complete a trial payment plan to
            demonstrate that the borrower will be able to make regularly
            scheduled payments as modified by the special loan servicing. For
            borrowers who are in default when special loan servicing is
            initiated, the trial payment plan shall be three months in length.
            For borrowers facing imminent default when special loan servicing is
            initiated, the trial payment plan shall be four months in 
            <PRTPAGE P='252' />
            length. The borrower&apos;s monthly payment during the trial payment
            plan shall equal the monthly payment that would be owed by the
            borrower following the special loan servicing. During this trial
            period, the Lender shall service the mortgage in the same manner as
            it would service a mortgage under a special forbearance agreement
            (i.e., the Lender shall review the status of the plan each month and
            take appropriate action if the borrower is not complying with the
            terms of the plan). If the borrower does not successfully complete
            the trial payment plan by making each of the monthly payments on
            time, the borrower is not eligible for special loan servicing. If
            the borrower begins but does not successfully complete a trial
            payment plan, the Lender should consider the borrower for voluntary
            liquidation and deed in lieu of foreclosure before proceeding to
            foreclosure.

             The Lender may modify the loan by reducing the interest rate to a
            level at or below the maximum allowable interest rate and extending
            the repayment term up to a maximum of 40 years from the date of loan
            modification. The interest rate must be fixed. RHS may establish the
            maximum allowable interest rate by publishing a notice in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register
            </E>
             describing how to calculate the rate. If the maximum allowable
            interest rate has not been established by notice in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register,
            </E>
             the maximum allowable interest rate shall be 50 basis points
            greater than the most recent Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage
            Market Survey (PMMS) rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages (U.S.
            average), rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent (0.125%),
            as of the date the loan modification is executed. Weekly PMMS rates
            are published on the Freddie Mac Web site, and the Federal Reserve
            Board includes the average 30-year PMMS rate in the list of Selected
            Interest Rates that it publishes weekly in its Statistical Release
            H.15. The term shall be extended only as long as is necessary to
            achieve the targeted mortgage payment to income ratio after the
            interest rate has been fixed at a level at or below the maximum
            allowable rate. Expenses related to special loan servicing shall not
            be charged to the borrower. Such expenses include title search fees
            and recording fees, but not legal fees and costs related to a
            cancelled foreclosure initiated prior to special loan servicing.
            Legal fees and costs related to a cancelled foreclosure may be
            capitalized into the modified principal balance provided that such
            foreclosure costs reflect work actually completed prior to the date
            of the foreclosure cancellation. Late fees should not be capitalized
            into the modified loan.

          <text>
             The maximum mortgage recovery advance consists of the sum of
            arrearages not to exceed 12 months of PITI; legal fees and
            foreclosure costs related to a cancelled foreclosure action; and
            principal reduction. The maximum mortgage recovery advance is 30
            percent of the unpaid principal balance as of the date of default.
            The principal deferment on the modified mortgage is determined by
            multiplying the unpaid principal balance by 30 percent and then
            reducing that amount by arrearages advanced to cure the default and
            any foreclosure costs incurred to that point. The principal
            deferment amount for a specific case shall be limited to the amount
            that will bring the borrower&apos;s total monthly mortgage payment
            to 31 percent of gross monthly income. Expenses related to special
            loan servicing shall not be charged to the borrower. Such expenses
            include title search fees and recording fees, but not legal fees and
            costs related to a cancelled foreclosure initiated prior to special
            loan servicing. Legal fees and foreclosure costs related to a
            cancelled foreclosure action may be included in the mortgage
            recovery advance provided that such foreclosure costs reflect work
            actually completed prior to the date of the foreclosure
            cancellation. Late fees should not be included in a mortgage
            recovery advance.

          If the Lender concludes the liquidation of a guaranteed loan account
          is necessary because of one or more defaults or third party actions
          that the borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a
          reasonable period of time, the Lender will notify RHS of the decision
          to liquidate. Initiation of foreclosure begins with the first public
          action required by law such as filing a complaint or petition,
          recording a notice of default, or publication of a notice of sale.
          Foreclosure must be initiated within 90 days of the date the decision
          to liquidate is made unless the foreclosure has been delayed by law.

            other sources shall also be applied to the total unpaid debt.
            Determination of net proceeds will be different depending on which

            disposition plan to RHS for RHS concurrence. The plan will address
            the Lender&apos;s proposed method for sale of the property, the
            estimated value and minimum sale price, itemized estimated costs of
            the sale, and any other information that could impact the amount of
            loss on the loan. The Lender is allowed up to 6 months from the date
            the property is acquired to sell the property. Upon the
            Lender&apos;s written request, RHS will authorize one extension not
            to exceed 30 days to close the sale of a purchase offer accepted
            near the end of the 6-month period. Net proceeds will be based on
            the net proceeds received for the property when the sale is
            conducted in accordance with the plan as approved by RHS. If no sale
            offer is accepted within the 6-month period, then the RHS approval
            official will obtain and use a liquidation value appraisal of the
            property. When an appraisal is obtained, the amount of the net
            proceeds from the security is then determined by subtracting a cost
            factor, which is found in exhibit D of FmHA Instruction 1980-D
            (available in any RHS office), from the current market value.

          RHS is authorized to provide interest assistance payments subject to
          the availability of funds. Regardless of what date a borrower&apos;s
          loan payment is due each month, interest assistance payments will be

            the State Director makes a written request for it and provides
            documentation that low-income borrowers in the area could not afford
            to purchase a dwelling under the interest assistance table in
            exhibit D of FmHA Instruction 1980-D (available in any RHS office).
            The area must also be designated by HUD as a high cost area. The
            amount of additional interest assistance for high cost areas is 1
            percent; however, in no case will more interest assistance be
            granted than the amount necessary to reach the lowest floor rate in
            exhibit D of FmHA Instruction 1980-D (available in any RHS office).

             The change in a designation to (or from) a high cost area will not

            high cost designation is determined at the time of issuance of the

             The RHS approval official will calculate shared equity when a
            borrower&apos;s account is settled by payment-in-full (including
            refinancing) of the outstanding indebtedness, the transfer of title,
            or when the borrower ceases to occupy the property. The calculation
            of shared equity when the account is in liquidation will be handled
            in accordance with

          <text>
             The amount of shared equity will be based on the amount of interest
            assistance granted on the loan, the appreciation in property value
            between the closing date of the loan and the date the account is
            satisfied or acquired by the Lender via liquidation action, the
            period of time the loan is outstanding, the amount of original
            equity the borrower has in the property, and the value of capital
            improvements to the property. Shared equity will be the lesser of
            the interest assistance granted or the amount of value appreciation
            available for shared equity. Value appreciation available for shared
            equity means the market value of the property less all debts secured
            by prior liens, sales expenses, any original borrower equity,
            principal reduction, and value added by any capital improvements.

             MCCs are authorized under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and allow the
            borrower to receive a Federal tax credit for a percentage of their
            mortgage interest payment. They may be used by RHS guaranteed RH
            borrowers to improve their repayment ability for the loan. MCCs
            impact on the borrower&apos;s tax liability. MCCs may be used with
            interest assisted loans when the amount of the tax credit is based 
            <PRTPAGE P='262' />
            on the amount of interest actually paid by the borrower. MCCs are
            subject to shared equity of a portion of any “gain” realized on the
            property when sold within 10 years after purchase. If the loan is
            also an RHS interest assisted loan, RHS shall receive priority for
            shared equity repayment. Income taxes are complex issues; RHS
            employees and Lenders are not expected to be able to identify all
            issues impacting the borrower&apos;s taxes. Lenders should encourage
            borrowers to consult with a tax advisor.

          <text>
             A funded buydown account is a prepaid arrangement between a builder
            or a seller and a Lender that is designed to improve
            applicant&apos;s repayment ability. Funded buydown accounts are
            permitted when the Lender obtains prior RHS concurrence. RHS will
            consider buydown accounts when there are compensating factors which
            indicate the borrower&apos;s ability to meet the expected increases
            in loan payment. The seller, Lender or other third party must place
            funds in an escrow account with monthly releases scheduled directly
            to the Lender to reduce the borrower&apos;s monthly payment during
            the early years of the loan. The maximum reduction which may be
            considered is 2 percent below the note rate, even though the actual
            buydown may be for more. Reductions in buydown assistance may not
            result in an increase in the interest rate paid by the borrower of
            more than 1 percent per year. The borrower shall not be required to
            repay escrowed buydown funds. Funds must be escrowed with a state or
            federally supervised Lender. Funded buydown accounts must be fully
            funded for the buydown period. Buydown periods must be at least 12
            months for each 1 percent of the buydown.

          The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any
          requirement or provision of this subpart or address any omission of
          this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or
          other applicable law if the Administrator determines that application
          of the requirement, or provision, or failure to take action in the
          case of an omission would adversely affect the Government&apos;s
          financial interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority
          upon request of the State Director with the recommendation of the
          Assistant Administrator for Housing. Requests for exception must be
          made in writing accompanied by the borrower&apos;s casefile in cases
          involving specific borrowers and supported with documentation to
          explain the adverse effect, propose alternative courses of action, and
          to show how the adverse effect will be eliminated or minimized if the
          exception is granted.

            loan. Such incidents will be brought to the Lender&apos;s attention
            in writing. Examples of minor deficiencies include improperly
            completed builder certifications, use of an outdated credit report,
            or use of an outdated income verification. Minor deficiencies also
            include those significant deficiencies when the Lender is willing
            and able to correct the problem such as obtaining flood insurance
            for a dwelling located in a flood hazard area and assuring the
            escrow amount is sufficient.

             A significant deficiency is one that creates a significant risk of

            in probation or withdrawal of the Lender&apos;s approval for program
            participation. Examples of significant deficiencies include gross
            miscalculation of income, acceptance of property that is severely
            deficient of the required standards, missing builder certifications,
            and construction changes that materially affect value without proper

            finance business, industry and employment and improve the economic
            and environmental climate in rural communities, including pollution
            abatement and control. This purpose is achieved through bolstering
            the existing private credit structure through guarantee of quality
            loans which will provide lasting community benefits. It is NOT
            intended that the guarantee authority be used for marginal or
            substandard loans or to “bail out” lenders having such loans.

             A variable interest rate must be a rate that is tied to a base rate
            published periodically in a recognized national or regional
            financial publication specifically agreed to by the lender and
            borrower. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different
            intervals during the term of the loan but the adjustments may not be
            more often than quarterly. The intervals between interest rate
            adjustments will be specified in the Loan Agreement. The lender 
            <PRTPAGE P='272' />
            must incorporate within the variable rate promissory note at loan
            closing, the provision for adjustment of payment installments
            coincident with an interest rate adjustment. This will assure that
            the outstanding principal balance is properly amortized within the
            prescribed loan maturity to eliminate the possibility of a balloon
            payment at the end of the loan.

             Variable rates can be changed to reduced fixed rates. In a final
            loss settlement, when qualifying rate changes were made with the
            required written agreements and notification, the interest will be
            calculated for the periods the given rates were in effect, except
            that interest claimed on a loan which originated at a variable rate
            can never exceed the amount which would have been eligible for claim
            had the variable interest remained in force. The lesser

            cost to the Government will always prevail. The lender must maintain
            records which adequately document the accrued interest claimed.

            reviewing the application fully evaluates the useful life of the
            collateral offered for the loan when determining maturities for the
            loan. Loan requests for the maximum maturities could result in
            collateral obsolescence prior to full repayment of the indebtedness.
            The loan file must be documented to support the maturity granted for
            the loan.

             A minimum of 10 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be
            required for existing businesses at loan closing. A minimum of 20
            percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for new
            businesses at loan closing. For energy projects, the minimum
            tangible balance sheet equity requirement range will be between 25
            percent and 40 percent. Criteria for considering the minimum equity
            required for an individual application will be based on: existing
            businesses with successful financial and management history vs.
            start-up businesses; personal/corporate guarantees offered;
            contractual relationships with suppliers and buyers; credit rating;
            and strength of the business plan/feasibility study. Where the
            application is a request to refinance outstanding Federal direct or
            guaranteed loans, without any new financing, the equity requirement
            may be determined using adjusted tangible net worth. An application
            that combines a refinancing loan or guarantee request with a new
            loan or guarantee request is subject to the standard, unadjusted,
            equity requirement except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2)
            of this section. Increases or decreases in the equity requirements
            may be imposed or granted as follows:

            is met, “adjusted tangible net worth,” may be used only in cases
            where the guarantee requested is for a loan, the proceeds of which
            are to be used entirely to refinance a debt owed to the Federal
            government or Federally guaranteed debt. In all other situations,
            the equity requirement must be determined using tangible net worth.

            have previous experience in the design and analysis of similar
            facilities and/or processes as are proposed in the application. The
            technical feasibility reports shall address the suitability of the
            selected site for the intended use, including an environmental
            impact analysis. The report shall be based upon verifiable data and
            contain sufficient information and analysis so that a determination
            may be made on the technical feasibility of achieving the levels of
            income and/or production that are projected in the financial
            statements. The report shall also identify any constraints or
            limitations in these financial projections and any other facility or
            design related factors which might affect the success of the
            enterprise. The report shall also identify and estimate project
            operating and development costs and specify the level of accuracy of
            these estimates and the assumptions on which these estimates have
            been based. For the purpose of the technical feasibility reports,
            the project engineer or architect may be considered an independent
            party provided the principals of the firm or any individual of the
            firm who participates in the technical feasibility report does not
            have a financial interest in the project, and provided further that
            no other individual or firm with the expertise necessary to make
            such a determination is reasonably available to perform the
            function.

             Appraisal reports prepared by independent qualified fee appraisers
            will be required on all property that will serve as collateral. In
            the case of loans two million dollars or less, the State Director
            may modify this requirement by permitting the appraisal to be made
            by a qualified appraiser on the lender&apos;s staff with experience
            appraising the type of collateral involved. The appraisers will give
            their opinion regarding the current market value of the collateral
            and the purpose for which the appraisal will be used. The lender
            will be responsible for assuring that appropriate appraisals are

             Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, any public body

            meets the thresholds established by OMB Circular A-128 or A-133 for
            coverage under such circular, must provide an audit in accordance
            with the applicable OMB Circular A-128 or A-133 for the fiscal year
            of the borrower in which the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. If the
            loan is for development or purchases made in a previous fiscal year
            through interim financing, an audit, in accordance with the
            applicable circular, will also be provided for the fiscal year in
            which the development or purchases occurred. Any audit provided by a
            public body or nonprofit corporation in compliance with OMB Circular
            A-128 or A-133 will be considered adequate to meet the requirements
            of this section for that year. OMB Circulars are available from the

             449-14. When analyzing the B&amp;I loan request, the State Loan
            Review Board will specifically address the issue of the guarantee
            percentage to be approved. Consideration of reducing the maximum
            guarantee to less than 90 percent is appropriate when the loan has
            sufficient strength to warrant further participation by the private
            sector or refinancing of existing lender debts to the borrower is
            involved. Ordinarily, B&amp;I loan guarantees should be structured
            so that the lender bears a significant portion of the risk of loss
            from a default. “Significant” means equal to or greater than 20
            percent of the loss stemming from default. All review board meetings
            will be fully documented, including the review and decision
            concerning the guarantee percentage, and will be signed by those
            FmHA or its successor agency under

            5. Prior to submission of a B&amp;I guaranteed loan(s) request to
            the National Office for loan processing review and prior to loan
            approval, the appropriate loan processing official must visit the
            project site and discuss the loan proposal with the lender and
            borrower. In the event there are multiple project sites the official
            should visit a representative sample of project sites to develop
            deeper understanding of the project operation. For businesses
            without a developed project site a visit is not necessary; however,
            a visit with the lender and borrower is still required. The findings
            of the visit should be documented in the loan docket submitted to
            the National Office.

             449-14, the State Director will further negotiate these
            recommendations with the lender and proposed borrower. If, as a
            result of these further negotiations, the lender, proposed borrower
            or State Director presents alternate conditions which would result
            in a change in the scope of the proposed project and if the loan
            exceeds the State Director&apos;s loan approval authority, the State
            Director will submit these conditions by memorandum to the National

             There is a close relationship between classifications; and no
            classifications category should be viewed as more important than the
            other. The uncollectibility aspect of Doubtful and Loss
            classifications are of obvious importance; however, the function of
            the Substandard classification is to indicate those loans that are
            unduly risky which may result in future claims against the B&amp;I
            guarantee.

            classification but do possess credit deficiencies deserving the
            lender&apos;s close attention. Failure to correct these deficiencies
            could result in greater credit risk in the future. This
            classification would include loans that the lender is unable to
            supervise properly because of a lack of expertise, an inadequate
            loan agreement, the condition of or lack of control over the
            collateral, failure to obtain proper documentation or any other
            deviations from prudent lending practices. Adverse trends in the
            borrower&apos;s operation or an imbalanced position in the balance
            sheet which has not reached a point that jeopardizes the repayment
            of the loan should be assigned to this designation. Loans in which
            actual, not potential, weaknesses are evident and significant should
            be considered for a Substandard classification.

            servicing and protecting the collateral, the State Director is
            responsible for seeing that servicing as required by the
            Lender&apos;s Agreement and regulation is properly accomplished.
            Loan servicing is intended to be a preventive rather than a curative
            action. Prompt followup on delinquent accounts and early recognition
            of potential problems and pursuing a solution to them are keys to
            resolving many problem loan cases.

            caused by negligent servicing or use of loan funds for unauthorized
            purposes can be withheld from the final loss claim submitted by the
            lender. The dollar amount withheld from the final loss claim must be
            ascertainable. In order to determine the final loss amount, the
            guaranteed loan collateral and any collateral of the guarantor(s)

            writing that (a) the acts of negligent servicing and/or use of loan
            funds for unauthorized purposes will cause the guarantee to be
            unenforceable by the lender to the extent these acts cause a loss;

            to the attention of OGC—even if no payment of the loss claim has
            occurred yet. (This would include those situations in which a

            might be necessary to ask OIG to do an investigation to establish
            all the aspects of the fraud. If at all possible, this should then

            4. There are two methods the Government could use to seek relief for
            the fraud. One of the ways the Government could seek redress for the
            fraud is to sue under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              sections 3729-3731
            </aref>
            ). If fraud is proven to have occurred, the False Claims Act
            provides for the recovery of double damages and a $2,000 penalty
            (and the costs of one civil suit) for each act involving, for
            example: (a) Knowingly submitting to a Government employee of false
            or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, (b) knowingly making or
            using a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim
            paid or approved, or (c) conspiring to defraud the United States by
            getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid. Suit under the
            False Claims Act must be filed within six years from the date of the
            commission of the act (e.g., presentation of the claim to FmHA or
            its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
             for payment). The double damage feature ought to be a good
            incentive to convince OIG to undertake necessary investigations to
            help establish the fraud.
          </P>
          <P>
            5. In order to decide whether to file suit, the Department of
            Justice will need to know such things as: What was the amount of the
            loan or the loss paid to the lender or holder? How much did the
            scheme cost the Government? What is the difference in money between
            what the Government paid out and what it should have paid out? Does
            the borrower or lender have enough assets to make it worth suing? If
            FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
             can answer these questions before referral to OGC—either on its own
            or by using OIG—than OGC can refer the matter that much more quickly
            to the Justice Department.
          </P>
          <P>
            6. There is also a way to bring suit for civil fraud by alleging
            that “common law” fraud occurred. This would just involve proving
            that a borrower or a lender falsely represented by their words or
            actions, a matter of fact either by alleging something in a false or
            misleading manner or by concealing something that should have been
            disclosed; and that FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
             was deceived by this conduct, and relied on it to its detriment.
            Under “common law” fraud, only single damages could be recovered,
            and there would be no $2,000 penalty assessed. The action would
            generally have to be brought within three years from the date of the
            discovery of the fraud.
          </P>
          <P>
            7. Neither the False Claims Act nor the right to bring a “common
            law” action for fraud precludes the Government from just suing to
            recover the money wrongfully or mistakenly paid by its employees. If
            the Justice Department decides not to pursue a civil frauds claim
            under the False Claims Act or “common law,” it will return the
            matter to OGC. Depending on what stage the proceedings were in when
            the matter was first referred, FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
             could then continue to negotiate with the lender or OGC could
            re-refer the case to Justice for any contract-based actions,
            including fraud or misrepresentation based on the terms of the
            guarantee.

            adversely affecting the risks of the FmHA or its successor agency
            under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 103-354
            </aref>
             and the lender must become the paramount objective. Within the
            State Director&apos;s authority temporary curative actions such as
            payment deferments, moratoriums on payments or collateral
            subordination, if approved, must strengthen the loan and be in the
            best interests of the lender and FmHA or its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

            deferral, rescheduling, reamortization or moratorium is limited by
            the period of time authorized by this subpart for the purpose for
            which the loan(s) is made or the remaining useful life of the
            collateral securing the loan. For example, if the promissory note on
            a working captial loan is scheduled to mature in 2 years the loan
            could be rescheduled for 7 years or the 
            <PRTPAGE P='298' />
            remaining life of the collateral whichever is the lesser of the two.

            deduction from the principal amount of the loan and interest cannot
            be accrued on the principal amount of the loan that is equal to the
            estimated loss payment. Community and Business Program Chiefs
            (C&amp;BP), Business and Industry Chiefs or Loan Specialists will
            conduct such reviews. The State Director may request National Office
            assistance in the conduct of any review. All reviews for final loss
            claim in excess of the State Director&apos;s approval authority (See
            Subpart A of 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              Part 1901 of

             this Chapter) will be submitted to the National Office, Business
            and Industry Division, for concurrence prior to the State
            Director&apos;s approval of the claim. Close scrutiny of liquidation
            proceeds and their application in accordance with lien priorities is
            required. Before final loss payments are approved and to assist in
            the required review, the C&amp;BP Chief, B&amp;I Chief or Loan
            Specialist will prepare a narrative history of the guarantee
            transaction which will serve as the summary of occurrence which led
            to failure of the borrower and actions taken to maximize loan
            recovery. The original of this report will be filed in the loan case
            file. A copy of this report together with the review of the final
            loss claim will be included in the material sent to the Director,
            B&amp;I Division, for review prior to approval of final loss
            payments.

          <P>
            A. Protective advances will not be made in lieu of additional loans,
            in particular, working capital loans. Protective advances are
            advances made by the lender for the purpose of preserving and
            protecting the collateral where the debtor has failed to and will
            not or cannot meet its obligations. Ordinarily, protective advances
            are made when liquidation is contemplated or in process. A precise
            rule of when a protective advance should be made is impossible to
            state. A common, but by no means the only, period when protective
            advances might be needed is during liquidation. At this point, the
            borrower and success of the project are no longer of paramount
            importance, but preserving collateral for maximum recovery is of
            vital importance. Elements which should always be considered include
            how close the project is to liquidation or default, how much control
            the borrower will have over the funds, what danger is there that
            collateral may be destroyed and whether there will be a good chance
            of saving the collateral later if a protective advance in
            contemplation of liquidation is made immediately. A protective
            advance 
            <E T='03'>
              must
            </E>
             be an indebtedness of the borrower.
          </P>
          <P>
            B. The State Director must approve, in writing, all protective
            advances on loans 
            <PRTPAGE P='300' />
            within his/her loan approval authority which exceed a total
            commulative advance of $500 to the same borrower. Protective
            advances must be reasonable when associated with the value of
            collateral being preserved.
          </P>
          <P>
            C. When considering protective advances, sound judgment must be
            exercised in determining that the additional funds advanced will
            actually preserve collateral interests and recovery is actually
            enhanced by making the advance.

            B. All bankruptcy cases should be reported immediately to the

            C. Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business
            contemplating an ongoing business rather than a termination and
            dissolution of the business where legal protection is afforded to
            the business as defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
            Consequently, expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11
            reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unless the
            proceeding becomes a Liquidating 11. If the proceeding should become
            a Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may
            be deducted from proceeds of collateral provided the lender is doing
            the actual liquidation of the collateral as provided by the
            Lender&apos;s Agreement. Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the

            G. If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the
            reorganization plan, and the borrower repays in full the remaining
            balance of the loan as set forth in the plan without an additional
            loss sustained by the lender, a Final Report of Loss is not
            necessary. The Finance Office will close out the estimated loss
            account as a Final Loss at the time notification of payment in full

            I. Protective Advances—Authorized protective advances may be
            included with the estimated loss payment associated with the Chapter
            11 reorganization provided they were incurred in connection with
            liquidation of the account prior to the borrower filing bankruptcy.
          </P>
          <P>
            J. Adequate Protection—The bankruptcy court can order protection of
            the collateral while the borrower is in a reorganization bankruptcy.
            The lender whose collateral is subject to being used by the trustee
            in bankruptcy should immediately seek adequate protection of the
            collateral, including petitioning for a super priority.

             In analyzing the credit quality of a proposed loan to a business
            that has lost assets to a natural disaster, primary emphasis will be
            placed on the operating history of the business, rather than its
            current financial condition. If the business has a sound, profitable
            and successful history prior to the disaster and there are
            reasonable projections to ensure it can operate successfully in the
            future, the proposed loan may be approved even if disaster losses
            have caused somewhat less equity and/or collateral than would
            normally be expected for a B&amp;I loan guarantee. If the business
            appears to have had an unprofitable operation or inadequate cash
            flow prior to the disaster, the proposed loan guarantee will not be
            approved.

            cash flow operating cycle of the business. Installments will be
            scheduled for payment as agreed upon by the lender and borrower on
            terms that reasonably assure repayment of the loan. The first
            installment to include a repayment of principal may be scheduled for
            payment after the project is operational and has begun to generate
            income. However, such installment will be due and payable within 6
            years from the date of the debt instrument and at least annually
            thereafter. Interest will not be deferred and will be due at least
            annually from the date of the debt instrument. In granting a
            deferral of principal payment, the loan approval official must
            document based on pro forma financial statements and the nature of
            the crop that the deferral of payments is necessary.

             This section contains regulations for the Business and Industry
            Disaster (BID) loan program. The purpose of the program is to
            provide loan guarantees under the authority of the Dire Emergency
            Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 102-368' alt='Public Law 102-368' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d102:./list/bd/d102pl.lst:368%28Public_Laws%29'>
              Public Law 102-368
            </aref>
            . These guaranteed loans cover costs arising from the consequences
            of natural disasters such as Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon
            Omar that occur after August 23, 1992, and receive a Presidential
            declaration. Also included are the costs to any producer of crops
            and livestock that are a consequence of at least a 40 percent loss
            to a crop, 25 percent loss to livestock, or damage to building
            structures from a microburst wind occurrence in calendar year 1992.
            No BID loan guarantee will be approved after September 30, 1993. All
            provisions of subparts A and E of

            accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The amount of the

            ) to cure problems caused by the natural disaster so that the
            business is reestablished on a successful basis. Facilities which
            were damaged or destroyed by the natural disaster may be repaired or
            replaced by modern facilities as necessary to ensure success.
            Replacement by modern facilities will not be made solely for the
            purpose of enlarging the business or increasing its production
            capacity. No loan for a change of purpose of the business will be
            guaranteed. Eligible refinancing or working capital loans should not
            exceed the amount needed to overcome the financial distress caused
            by the disaster. Losses that were adequately paid by insurance or by
            loans or grants from other sources will not be covered by BID loans.
            BID loans may be used to supplement insurance payments and/or
            assistance from other sources when the insurance coverage or other
            assistance is not sufficient.

            disaster, the lender may be allowed to bring previously unguaranteed
            exposure under the guarantee. No loan will be refinanced unless the
            current market value of the collateral is at least equal to the
            amount of the loan to be refinanced plus any new loan amount.

            to a natural disaster, primary emphasis will be placed on the

            history prior to the disaster and there are reasonable projections
            to ensure it can operate successfully in the future, the proposed
            loan may be approved even if disaster losses have caused somewhat
            less equity and/or collateral than would normally be expected for a
            B&amp;I guarantee. If the business appears to have had an
            unprofitable operation or inadequate cash flow prior to the
            disaster, the proposed loan guarantee will not be approved.

            Installments will be scheduled for payment as agreed upon by the
            lender and borrower on terms that reasonably assure repayment of the
            loan. The first installment to include a repayment of principal may
            be scheduled for payment after the project is operable and has begun
            to generate income. However, such installment will be due and
            payable within 6 years from the date of the debt instrument and at
            least annually thereafter. All accrued interest will be due at least
            annually from the date of the debt instrument. In no case will
            interest be deferred. In granting a deferral of principal payment,
            the loan approval official must document based on pro forma
            financial statements and the nature of the crop that the deferral of
            payments is necessary.
