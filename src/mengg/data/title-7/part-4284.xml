             A grant may be considered for the amount needed to assist with the
            completion of a proposed project, provided that the project can
            reasonably be expected to be completed within 2 full years after it
            is begun. If grant funds are requested to establish or assist with
            an activity of more than 2 years duration, the amount of a grant
            approved in any fiscal year will be limited to the amount needed to
            assist with no more than 1 full year of operation. Subsequent grant
            requests may be considered in subsequent years, if needed to
            continue the operation, but funding for 1 year provides no assurance
            of additional funding in subsequent years.

             The State Director may assign up to 15 discretionary points to an
            application. If allocation of funds under National Office control is
            being considered, the Agency Administrator may assign up to 20
            additional discretionary 
            <PRTPAGE P='978' />
            points. Assignment of discretionary points by either the State
            Director or the Agency Administrator must include a written
            justification. Permissible justifications are geographic
            distribution of funds, special importance for implementation of a
            strategic plan in partnership with other organizations, or
            extraordinary potential for success due to superior project plans or

          This subpart implements the value-added agricultural product market
          development grant program (Value-Added Producer Grants (VAPG))
          administered by the Rural Business-Cooperative Service whereby grants
          are made to enable viable agricultural producers (those who are
          prepared to progress to the next business level of planning for, or
          engaging in, value-added production) to develop businesses that
          produce and market value-added agricultural products. The provisions
          of this subpart constitute the entire provisions applicable to this
          Program; the provisions of subpart A of this part do not apply to this
          subpart.

           A situation in which a person or entity has competing personal,
          professional, or financial interests that make it difficult for the
          person or business to act impartially. Regarding use of both grant and
          matching funds, Federal procurement standards prohibit transactions

          a financial or other interest in the outcome of the project; or that
          restrict open and free competition for unrestrained trade.
          Specifically, grant and matching funds may not be used to support
          costs for services or goods going to, or coming from, a person or
          entity with a real or apparent conflict of interest, including, but

            agricultural commodity and that they have produced and marketed for

             Planning funds may be used to pay for a qualified consultant to
            conduct and develop a feasibility study, business plan, and/or
            marketing plan associated with the processing and/or marketing of a
            value-added agricultural product. Planning funds may not be used to
            compensate applicants or family members for participation in
            feasibility studies. However, in-kind contribution of matching funds
            to cover applicant or family member participation in planning
            activities is allowed so long as the value of such contribution does
            not exceed a maximum of 25 percent of the total project costs and an
            adequate explanation of the basis for the valuation, referencing
            comparable market values, salary and wage data, expertise or
            experience of the contributor, per unit costs, industry norms, etc.,

            contributions is at the discretion of the Agency. Planning funds may
            not be used to evaluate the agricultural production of the commodity
            itself, other than to determine the project&apos;s input costs
            related to the feasibility of processing and marketing the

            operational costs directly related to the processing and/or
            marketing of the value-added product. Examples of eligible working
            capital expenses include designing or purchasing a financial
            accounting system for the project, paying salaries of employees
            without ownership or immediate family interest to process and/or
            market and deliver the value-added product to consumers, paying for
            inventory supply costs from a third party necessary to produce the
            value-added product from the agricultural commodity, and paying for
            a marketing campaign for the value-added product. In-kind
            contributions may include appropriately valued inventory of raw
            commodity to be used in the project. In-kind contributions of
            matching funds may also include contributions of time spent on
            eligible tasks by applicants or applicant family members so long as
            the value of such contribution does not exceed a maximum of 25
            percent of the total project costs and an adequate explanation of

          The Agency encourages applicants to contact their State Office well in
          advance of the application submission deadline, to ask questions and
          to discuss applicant and project eligibility potential. At its option,
          the Agency may establish a preliminary review deadline so that it may
          informally assess the eligibility of the application and its
          completeness. The result of the preliminary review is not binding on
          the Agency. To implement this section, the Agency will issue a

             As part of the application, applicants for both planning and
            working capital grants must suggest one or more relevant criterion
            that will be used to evaluate the performance of the grant project
            during its operational phase post-award, as benchmarks to ascertain
            whether or not the primary goals and objectives proposed in the work
            plan are accomplished during the project period. These benchmarks
            should relate to the overall project goal of creating and serving
            new markets, with a resulting increase in customer base and increase
            in revenues returning to the producer applicants; as well as to the
            practical and/or logistical activities and tasks to be accomplished
            during the project period. The Agency application package will
            provide additional instruction to assist applicants when responding
            to this criterion. Applicant suggested performance criteria will be
            incorporated into the applicant&apos;s semi-annual and final
            reporting requirements if selected for award, and will be specified
            in the grant agreement associated with the award. In addition,
            applicants for both planning and working capital grants must
            identify the number of jobs anticipated to be created or saved as a
            direct result of the project. Planning grant applicants should
            identify the number of jobs expected to be created or saved as a
            result of continuing the project into its operational phase. Working
            capital grant applicants should identify the actual number of jobs
            created or saved as a result of the project.

            purchased, as evidenced by letters of intent or contracts from
            potential buyers referenced within the application. Other
            Third-Party commitments to the project will be evaluated based on

            such as technical assistance, storage, processing, marketing, or
            distribution arrangements that are necessary for the project to
            proceed; and the level and quality of these contributions.
            Applications that demonstrate the project has strong direct
            financial, technical and logistical support to successfully complete
            the project will receive more points than those that demonstrate
            less potential for success in these areas.

             Grant disbursements will be made in accordance with the Letter of
            Conditions, and/or the grant agreement, as applicable. A
            disbursement request may be submitted by the grantee not more
            frequently than once every 30 days by using Form SF 270, “Request
            for Advance or Reimbursement.” The disbursement request is typically
            in the form of a reimbursement request for eligible expenses
            incurred by the grantee during the grant funding period. Adequate
            supporting documentation must accompany each request, and may
            include, but is not limited to, receipts, hourly wage rates,
            personnel payroll records, contract progression certification, or
            other similar documentation.

        <P>
          It is the policy of the Secretary of Agriculture to fund Centers which
          evidence broad support from the agricultural community in the state or
          region, significant coordination with end users (processing and
          distribution companies and regional grocers), strategic alliances with
          entities having technical research capabilities and a focused delivery
          plan for reaching out to the producer community. It is also the policy
          of the Secretary, using the research and technical services of the
          U.S. Department of Agriculture, to assist the grantees in establishing
          Centers. This program is not intended to fund scientific research.

        <P>
          The Agency will conduct an initial screening of all proposals to
          determine whether the applicant is eligible and whether the
          application is complete and sufficiently responsive to the
          requirements set forth in the applicable RFP so as to allow for an
          informed review. Incomplete or non-responsive applications will not be
          evaluated further, and may be returned to the applicant. Applicants
          may revise their applications and re-submit them prior to the
          published deadline if there is sufficient time to do so.

             After all proposals have been evaluated using the evaluation
            criteria and scored in accordance with the point allocation
            specified in the applicable RFP, Agency officials will present to
            the Administrator of RBS a list of all applications in rank order,
            together with funding level recommendations.

             The Administrator reserves the right to award additional points, as

            (e.g., to ensure geographic distribution, put emphasis on a specific
            commodity, or to accomplish presidential initiatives.) The maximum
            number of points that can be added to an application under this
            paragraph cannot exceed ten percent of the total points the
            application originally scored.

            highly specialized skills. Strong skills must be accompanied by a

            be responsible for performing the proposed tasks have the necessary
            qualifications and whether they have a track record of performing
            activities similar to those being proposed. If a consultant or
            others are to be hired, points may be awarded for consultants only
            if the proposal includes evidence of their availability and
            commitment as well. Proposals using in-house employees with strong
            track records in innovative activities will receive higher points
            relative to proposals that out-source expertise.

            opportunities with environmental stewardship and other rural
            amenities. Proposed Centers that show strong support from potential
            beneficiaries and coordination with other developmental

            such support.
