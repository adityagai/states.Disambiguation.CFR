        <P>
          This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating
          and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales
          under the Commodity Credit Corporation&apos;s (CCC) Export Enhancement
          Program (EEP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered
          together in order to select eligible commodities and eligible
          countries for EEP initiatives which will best meet the program&apos;s
          objectives. The objectives of the program are to discourage unfair
          trade practices by other countries, to increase U.S. agricultural
          commodity exports, and to encourage other countries exporting
          agricultural commodities to undertake serious negotiations on
          agricultural trade problems. Under the EEP, bonuses are made available
          by CCC to enable exporters to meet prevailing world prices for
          targeted commodities in targeted destinations. In the operation of the
          EEP, CCC will make reasonable efforts to avoid the displacement of
          usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.

          This subpart contains the regulations governing the operation of the
          Export Enhancement Program (EEP) of the Commodity Credit Corporation
          (CCC). CCC will, from time to time, announce, through public press
          release, initiatives to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural
          commodities to targeted markets. The public press release, which will
          contain the name of a person for interested parties to contact, will
          be followed by the issuance of an Invitation for Offers (Invitation).
          Invitations will be issued pursuant to this subpart by the General
          Sales Manager (GSM) and will specify the eligible country(ies) (the
          targeted market), the unit of measure, the eligible commodity, the
          maximum quantity of the eligible commodity eligible for a CCC bonus,
          the quality specifications of the eligible commodity (including
          possible restrictions on type, kind, grade and/or class or other
          quality specifications), the eligible buyer(s), the method and rate
          for determining liquidated damages and performance security
          requirements, and any other terms and conditions peculiar to that
          Invitation. Invitations may be one of the following two types: Those
          inviting exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer
          to submit a competitive offer for a CCC Bonus; and those inviting
          exporters which have a sales contract with an eligible buyer to apply
          for an Announced CCC Bonus. After an interested person has qualified
          to submit an offer for an eligible commodity, the eligible exporter
          may submit an offer to CCC in response to an Invitation. Such offer
          must contain the information required by this subpart and any
          additional information required by the applicable Invitation. The
          exporter&apos;s offer will include either the Announced CCC Bonus, if
          applicable, or an amount in dollars and cents for a bonus deemed
          necessary by the exporter to make a commercial sale of the eligible
          commodity for export to the eligible country competitive with export
          sales of the commodity by other exporting countries to buyers in the
          eligible country. If the exporter has furnished the required
          performance security and the offer is acceptable to CCC, then CCC will
          notify the exporter that its offer has been accepted. CCC and the
          exporter will enter into an Agreement in which CCC will agree to pay
          the bonus to the exporter in return for the exporter&apos;s submission
          of proof that the eligible commodity has been exported from the United
          States and entered into the eligible country, in accordance with the
          terms and conditions of the Agreement.

            brings the total entered quantity for any one EEP Agreement to at

             Prior to the submission of an offer to CCC in response to an
            Invitation, an eligible exporter must establish performance
            security, in a form which is acceptable to CCC, in order to
            guarantee the eligible exporter&apos;s faithful performance of the
            Agreement. If CCC enters into an Agreement with the eligible
            exporter, this performance security must remain in effect until its
            cancellation or reduction is authorized by CCC pursuant to paragraph
            (f) of this section. An offer made by an eligible exporter will not
            be considered if proof of the establishment of the performance
            security is not made available to CCC by 3 p.m. on the date for
            which the offer is submitted for consideration.

            performance security, the opening bank may be a U.S. bank or a
            foreign bank. If the standby letter of credit is opened by a foreign
            bank, it must be 100 percent confirmed by a U.S. bank. If a bond is
            furnished as performance security, the surety(ies) must be among

             The amount of the performance security to be furnished to CCC in
            response to a particular Invitation will depend upon whether the
            eligible exporter intends to select “Option A” or “Option B” for the
            timing of the bonus payment. If the eligible exporter furnishes
            performance security under “Option A” of the applicable Invitation,
            the eligible exporter may request payment of the bonus after export
            of the eligible commodity but before entry of the commodity into the
            eligible country. If the eligible exporter furnishes performance
            security under “Option B” of the applicable Invitation, the eligible
            exporter may request payment of the bonus only after the exported
            eligible commodity has entered into the eligible country. The
            applicable Invitation will specify the exact amount of performance
            security for the eligible commodity required under either “Option A”
            or “Option B” and the method and rate for determining liquidated
            damages. After the exporter and CCC enter into an Agreement, the
            exporter may request CCC to change the performance 
            <PRTPAGE P='998' />
            security option for an entire Agreement from “Option B” to “Option
            A” and, if CCC agrees to this change, the exporter will increase the
            performance security amount to the level required by the applicable
            Invitation for “Option A”.

             The quantity of the eligible commodity exported from the U.S. which
            is eligible for the payment of a CCC bonus is the net weight (less
            any dockage, if applicable) or count which is established by the
            Official Inspection Certificate, the Official Weight Certificate or
            the export bill of lading, whichever is less. If the exporter has
            furnished performance security under “Option A” of the applicable
            Invitation and wishes the bonus to be paid prior to the entry of the
            eligible commodity into the eligible country, this quantity will be
            used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of making
            payment to the exporter. If the exporter is not paid the bonus until
            the commodity enters into the eligible country, then this quantity
            will also be used in calculating the bonus value for the purposes of
            making payment to the exporter, unless in the determination of CCC,
            there is evidence to suggest that there was destruction, diversion
            or loss of the eligible commodity prior to entry into the eligible
            country. The payment of a bonus value to an exporter does not
            indicate that the bonus has been earned by the exporter under the
            Agreement; pursuant to 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            , the bonus is not earned by the exporter until the eligible

            breaches the Agreement, the exporter will be liable to pay to CCC as

            attempt to arrive at a new CCC bonus and/or sales price which would
            be acceptable to CCC. If these discussions are successful, then CCC
            may amend the Agreement to incorporate the exporter&apos;s requested
            change as well as the new CCC bonus and/or sales price, provided
            that the amendment would otherwise serve the best interests of the
            EEP. If these discussions are unsuccessful, then the Agreement will
            not be amended and the exporter will be considered to be in breach
            of the Agreement if it fails to perform under the terms of the
            Agreement.

             The exporter may seek reconsideration of a determination by the
            Director, CCCOD relating to the Agreement by submitting a letter
            requesting reconsideration to the Director, CCCOD, within 30 days of
            the date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the
            date of a determination will be the date of the letter or other
            means of notification to the exporter of the determination. The
            exporter may include with the letter requesting reconsideration any
            additional information which it wishes the Director, CCCOD, to
            consider in reviewing its request. The Director, CCCOD, will respond
            to the request for reconsideration within 30 days of the date on
            which the request or the final documentary evidence submitted by the
            exporter is received by him, whichever is later, unless the GSM
            extends the time permitted for response. If the exporter fails to
            request reconsideration of a determination by the Director, CCCOD,
            that the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then
            such funds will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the
            expiration of the 30-day period for submitting such a request.

            section, and the Director, CCCOD, upheld the original determination,
            then the exporter may appeal the determination to the GSM in
            accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this
            section. If the exporter fails to appeal the determination to the
            GSM, then any funds owed to CCC will become a debt of the exporter
            to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting an
            appeal to the GSM.

             An exporter which has exhausted the procedures set forth in
            paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the GSM a determination
            of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement between the
            exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing and filed
            with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the date
            of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal to
            the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing
            before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that
            it desires such a hearing.

            its appeal. This information or documentation may be submitted to
            the GSM up until the time that a decision is made by the GSM. The
            GSM will base the determination upon information contained in the
            administrative record. The GSM will endeavor to make a decision on
            an appeal not involving a hearing within 60 days of the date on
            which the GSM receives the appeal or the date that final documentary
            evidence is submitted by the exporter to the GSM, whichever is
            later.

            hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing which is
            mutually convenient for the GSM and the exporter. This date will
            ordinarily be within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives
            the request for hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure.
            The exporter and/or its counsel may present any administrative or
            documentary evidence to the GSM which it desires to have the GSM
            consider in making a determination. A transcript of the hearing will
            not ordinarily be prepared unless the exporter bears the costs
            involved in preparing the transcript, although the GSM may arrange 
            <PRTPAGE P='1009' />
            to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government if it
            is determined to be appropriate. The exporter may provide additional
            written information to the GSM up until the time that the GSM makes
            a determination. The GSM will base the determination upon the
            information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor
            to make a decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing or the
            date of receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared,
            whichever is later.

             For a period of five years after CCC agrees to the cancellation of
            an exporter&apos;s performance security for an Agreement, the
            exporter must maintain accurate records showing sales and deliveries
            of the eligible commodity exported in connection with the Agreement.
            The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the
            United States, through their authorized representatives, will have
            full and complete access to the premises of the exporter during
            regular business hours from the effective date of the Agreement
            until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine,
            audit and make copies of the exporter&apos;s books, records and
            accounts concerning transactions relating to the Agreement,
            including, but not limited to, financial records and accounts
            pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and
            incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen. From the effective
            date of the Agreement and until the expiration of such five-year
            period, the exporter may be required to make available to the
            Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General of the United
            States, through their authorized representatives, records that
            pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the
            opinion of the GSM, such records would pertain directly to the
            review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with
            the performance of an EEP Agreement.

        <P>
          This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating
          and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales
          under the Commodity Credit Corporation&apos;s (CCC) Dairy Export
          Incentive Program (DEIP). These criteria are interrelated and will be
          considered together in order to select eligible commodities and
          eligible countries for DEIP initiatives which will best meet the
          program&apos;s objectives. The objectives of the program are to
          increase U.S. agricultural commodity exports and to encourage other
          countries exporting agricultural commodities to undertake serious
          negotiations on agricultural trade problems. Under the DEIP, bonuses
          are made available by CCC to enable exporters to meet prevailing world
          prices for targeted dairy products in targeted destinations. In the
          operation of the DEIP, CCC will make reasonable efforts to avoid the
          displacement of commercial export sales of U.S. dairy products and to
          ensure that sales facilitated by the DEIP are in addition to, and not
          in place of, any export sales of dairy products that the exporter
          would have otherwise made in the absence of the program.
