          sorghum hay, sorghum haylage, sorghum billets, or sorghum silage from
          producers in a calendar year for marketing. The term first handler
          includes a producer who markets sorghum of the producer&apos;s own
          production directly to consumers. In any case in which sorghum is
          pledged as collateral for a loan issued under any Commodity Credit
          Corporation price support loan program and the sorghum is forfeited by
          the producer in lieu of loan repayment, the Commodity Credit
          Corporation will be considered a first handler.

             At least once every 5 years, the Board will review the geographical
            distribution of production of sorghum in the United States, the
            production of sorghum in the United States, and the value of
            assessments on sorghum imported into the United States. The review
            will be based on Board assessment records and statistics from the
            USDA. If warranted, the Board may recommend to the Secretary that
            representation on the Board be altered to reflect any changes in
            geographical distribution of domestic sorghum production. If, in the
            review, the Board determines that the value of assessments on
            sorghum imported into the United States exceeds 15 percent of the
            production of sorghum, the Board shall recommend to the Secretary
            that the nomination procedures and appointments to the Board be
            altered as necessary or appropriate to facilitate the equitable
            representation of importers on the Board.

             The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an
            organization shall be whether its sorghum producer membership
            consists of a sufficiently large number of sorghum producers who
            produce a relatively significant volume of sorghum to reasonably
            warrant its participation in the nomination of State specific and
            national at-large members to the Board. Any sorghum producer
            organization found eligible by the Secretary under this section
            shall be certified by the Secretary, and the Secretary&apos;s
            determination as to eligibility shall be final.

             The primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an
            organization shall be whether its sorghum producer membership
            consists of a sufficiently large number of sorghum producers who
            produce a relatively significant volume of sorghum to reasonably
            warrant its qualification to submit requests for funding to the
            Board. Any sorghum producer organization found eligible by the
            Secretary under this section will be qualified by the Secretary, and
            the Secretary&apos;s determination as to eligibility shall be final.
