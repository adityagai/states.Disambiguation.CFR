          Pending final action by the Secretary, any person authorized to
          countersign a license to perform surveillance inspection services may,
          whenever such action is necessary to assure that any inspection
          service is properly performed, suspend or revoke any license to
          perform inspection services issued pursuant to this part by giving
          notice of such action to the respective licensee, accompanied by a
          statement of the reasons. Within 7 days after the receipt of the
          suspension or revocation notice and statement of reasons, the licensee
          may file an appeal in writing to the Secretary, supported by any
          argument or evidence that the licensee may wish to offer as to why the
          license should not be suspended or revoked. 
          <PRTPAGE P='71' />
          After the expiration of the 7-day period and consideration of such
          argument and evidence, the Secretary will take appropriate action
          regarding the suspension or revocation. When no appeal is filed within
          the prescribed 7 days, the license is revoked or suspended.

          Federal inspectors may participate in certain political activities,
          including management and participation in political campaigns as
          allowed by Federal regulation and AMS directives. Inspectors are
          subject to these rules while they are on leave with or without pay,
          including furlough; however the rules do not apply to cooperative
          employees not under Federal supervision and intermittent employees on
          the days they perform no service. Willfull violations of the political
          activity rules constitute grounds for removal from the service.
