             The guidelines in this part apply to all procurement actions by
            procuring agencies involving items designated by USDA in this part,
            where the procuring agency purchases $10,000 or more worth of one of
            these items during the course of a fiscal year, or where the
            quantity of such items or of functionally equivalent items purchased
            during the preceding fiscal year was $10,000 or more. The $10,000
            threshold applies to Federal agencies as a whole rather than to
            agency subgroups such as regional offices or subagencies of a larger
            Federal department or agency.

            agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing
            specifications for items procured by Federal agencies shall ensure
            within a specified time frame that their specifications require the

            time frame in each designation rule. The biobased content of a
            designated item may vary considerably from product to product based
            on the mix of ingredients used in its manufacture. In procuring
            designated items, the percentage of biobased product content should
            be maximized, consistent with achieving the desired performance for
            the product.

             Designated items are listed in subpart B. In designating items,
            USDA will designate items composed of generic groupings of specific
            products and will identify the minimum biobased content for each
            listed item. As items are designated for procurement preference,
            they will be added to subpart B. Items are generic groupings of
            specific products. Products are specific products offered for sale
            by a manufacturer or vendor. Although manufacturers and vendors may
            submit recommendations to USDA for future item designations at any
            time, USDA does not have a formal process for such submissions or
            for responding to such submissions.

             USDA will maintain a voluntary Web-based information site for
            manufacturers and vendors of designated items produced with biobased
            products and Federal agencies to exchange product information. This

            product information for designated items. Instructions for posting
            information are found on the Web site itself. USDA also encourages
            Federal agencies to utilize this Web site to obtain current
            information on designated items, contact information on
            manufacturers and vendors, and access to information on product
            characteristics relevant to procurement decisions. In addition to
            any information provided on the Web site, manufacturers and vendors
            are expected to provide relevant information to Federal agencies,
            upon request, with respect to product characteristics, including
            verification of such characteristics if requested.

             In assessing performance of qualifying biobased products, USDA
            requires that procuring agencies rely on results of performance
            tests using applicable ASTM, ISO, Federal or military
            specifications, or other similarly authoritative industry test
            standards. Such testing must be conducted by an ASTM/ISO compliant
            laboratory. The procuring official will decide whether performance
            data must be brand-name specific in the case of products that are
            essentially of the same formulation.

             If biodegradability is claimed by the manufacturer of a qualifying
            biobased product as a characteristic of that product, USDA requires
            that, if requested by procuring agencies, these claims be verified
            using the appropriate, product-specific ASTM biodegradability
            standard(s). Such testing must be conducted by an ASTM/ISO-compliant

             USDA will use funds to support testing for biobased content and
            conduct of BEES testing for products within items USDA has selected
            to designate for preferred procurement through early regulatory
            action. USDA initially will focus on gathering the necessary test
            information on a sufficient number of products within an item
            (generic grouping of products) to support regulations to be
            promulgated to designate an item or items for preferred procurement
            under this program. USDA may accept cost sharing for such testing to
            the extent consistent with USDA product testing decisions. During
            this period USDA will not consider cost sharing in deciding what
            products to test. When USDA has concluded that a critical mass of
            items have been designated, USDA will exercise its discretion, in
            accordance with the competitive procedures outlined in paragraph (b)
            of this section, to allocate a portion of the available USDA testing
            funds to give priority to testing of products for which private
            sector firms provide cost sharing for the testing.

             No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with
            this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying
            biobased plastic insulating foam for residential and commercial
            construction. By that date, Federal agencies that have the
            responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to
            be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require
            the use of biobased plastic insulating foam for residential and
            commercial construction.

             Qualifying biobased products that fall under this item may, in some
            cases, overlap with the EPA-designated recovered content product:
            Building Insulation. USDA is requesting that manufacturers of these
            qualifying biobased products provide information on the BioPreferred
            Web site of qualifying biobased products about the intended uses of
            the product, information on whether or not the product contains any
            recovered material, in addition to biobased ingredients, and
            performance standards against which the product has been tested.
            This information will assist Federal agencies in determining whether
            or not a qualifying biobased product overlaps with EPA-designated
            building insulation and which product should be afforded the
            preference in purchasing.

            afforded the preference in purchasing.

            biobased products about the intended uses of the product,

             Products designed to provide lubrication under a variety of
            conditions and in a variety of industrial settings to prevent
            friction or rust. Greases, which are lubricants composed of oils
            thickened to a semisolid or solid consistency using soaps, polymers
            or other solids, or other thickeners, are not included in this item.
            In addition, task-specific lubricants, such as chain and cable
            lubricants and gear lubricants, are not included in this item.

             Qualifying products within this item may overlap with the
            EPA-designated recovered content product: Re-refined lubricating
            oils. USDA is requesting that manufacturers of these qualifying
            biobased products provide information on the BioPreferred Web site
            about the intended uses of the product, information on whether or
            not the product contains any recovered material, in addition to
            biobased ingredients, and performance standards against which the
            product has been tested. This information will assist Federal
            agencies in determining whether or not a qualifying biobased product
            overlaps with EPA-designated re-refined lubricating oils and which
            product should be afforded the preference in purchasing.

            overlap with the EPA-designated recovered content products:
            Reprocessed latex paints and consolidated latex paints. USDA is
            requesting that manufacturers of these qualifying biobased products
            provide information on the USDA Web site of qualifying biobased
            products about the intended uses of the product, information on
            whether or not the product contains any recovered material, in
            addition to biobased ingredients, and performance standards against
            which the product has been tested. This information will assist
            Federal agencies in determining whether or not a qualifying biobased
            product overlaps with EPA-designated reprocessed latex paints and
            consolidated latex paints and which product should be afforded the
            preference in purchasing.

            or not a qualifying biobased product overlaps with EPA-designated
            floor tile products and which product should be afforded the
