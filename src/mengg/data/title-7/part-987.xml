          A California Date Administrative Committee consisting of nine members
          is hereby established to administer the terms and conditions of this
          part. For each member there shall be an alternate member, and the
          provisions of this part applicable to the number, nomination,
          qualification and selection of members shall apply in like manner 
          <PRTPAGE P='549' />
          to alternate members. Three of the members, referred to in this part
          as “producer members”, shall be producers or officers or employees of
          producers, and shall not be handlers, or directors, officers, or
          employees exercising a supervisory or managerial function of a
          handler. The six remaining members, referred to in this part as
          “producer-handlers”, shall be selected from (a) handlers, or
          directors, officers or employees of a handler, or (b) producers who
          are also handlers or directors, officers or employees exercising a
          supervisory or managerial function of a handler. The Committee, with
          the approval of the Secretary, may issue rules and regulations
          covering matters of eligibility for producer members, or revising the
          composition of the Committee prescribed in this section if it no
          longer is representative following a substantial change in the
          industry.

            producer-handler alternate members, shall be given the opportunity
            to vote for one member and one alternate member position. His ballot
            shall be weighted by the pounds of dates he had certified as
            marketable dates, from the beginning of the then current crop year
            through April which he produced in his own gardens or acquired from
            other producers. The individual receiving the highest weighted vote

          shall recommend to the Secretary requirements as to grade based on the
          effective United States Standards for Grades of Dates or any
          modification thereof, and such size requirements as it may deem
          appropriate. If the Secretary finds, upon the basis of such
          recommendation or other information available to him, that such
          additional grade or size regulation, or both such regulations, will
          tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall establish
          such regulations. Notice thereof, showing the effective date, shall be
          sent by the Committee to all handlers of record. On and after the
          effective date no handler shall handle dates of such variety in any

             Compliance by any handler with the withholding of restricted dates
            may be deferred to any date not later than January 31 of any crop
            year, upon request to the Committee and when accompanied by a
            written undertaking that on or prior to such date, he will have
            fully satisfied his withholding obligation. Such undertaking shall
            be secured by a bond or bonds to be filed with, and acceptable to,
            the Committee and with a surety or sureties acceptable to the
            Committee, running in favor of the Committee and the Secretary in an
            amount conditioned upon full compliance with such undertaking. The
            amount shall be determined by multiplying the poundage of the

            would provide funds estimated to be sufficient for the Committee to
            purchase on the open market a volume of dates equivalent to the

            obligation, reimburse the Committee for expenses relative to the
            default, and any excess money remaining shall be refunded to the
            defaulting handler. The dates so purchased by the Committee shall be
            turned over to the defaulting handler for disposition as restricted
            dates. In the event the Committee is unable to purchase a poundage
            of dates equal to the defaulted volume, the sums collected shall,
            after reimbursement of Committee expenses in connection with the
            default, be distributed among all handlers other than the defaulting
            handler in proportion to the volume of certified dates handled as
            free dates (including those for further processing that were handled
            as free

          Whenever the Committee deems it advisable to establish a container
          regulation for any variety of dates, it shall recommend to the
          Secretary the size, capacity, weight, or pack of the container, or
          containers, which may be used in the handling or packaging of dates,
          or both. If the Secretary finds upon the basis of such recommendation
          or other information available to him that such container regulation
          would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act he shall
          establish such regulation and notice thereof showing the effective
          date shall be sent by the Committee to all handlers of record. After
          the effective date of such regulation, no handler shall handle dates
          of such variety except in accordance with such regulation and all
          other applicable requirements in effect pursuant to this part.

            reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Committee during each
            crop year. Should the condition arise wherein the utility portion of
            dates handled in certain other outlets should not be, in the opinion
            of the Committee, subject to the payment of assessments on that
            portion, the Committee may recommend and the Secretary approve by
            rulemaking, such exclusion. Each handler&apos;s pro rata share shall
            be the rate of assessment per hundredweight fixed by the Secretary.
            At any time during or after a crop year the Secretary may increase
            such assessment rate to secure sufficient funds to cover
            unanticipated expenses or a deficit in assessable poundage. Any such
            increase shall apply to all assessable poundage of the crop year.
            The Committee may accept payments of assessments in advance and may
            borrow money in any amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated
            expenses set forth in its budget for the then crop year. The

            the weight of such dates by a divisor established by the Committee

            weight, that determined by the Committee on the basis of the number
            and size of the containers used in the delivery. Upon delivery of

             Each approved manufacturer of date products is required to renew
            their approved manufacturer status with the committee by submitting
            an updated CDAC Form No. 3 at the end of a crop year, but no later
            than October 10 of the new crop year. In addition, 
            <PRTPAGE P='570' />
            the approved manufacturer must continue to meet the other approved
            manufacturer qualification requirements.

             In the event an approved date product manufacturer who is also a
            regulated date handler within the area of production does not remain
            in compliance with the order, or fails or refuses to submit reports
            or to pay assessments required by the committee, such date product
            manufacturer shall become ineligible to continue as an approved date
            product manufacturer. Prior to making a determination to remove a
            date product manufacturer from the approved date product
            manufacturer list, the committee shall notify such manufacturer in
            writing of its intention and the reasons for removal. The committee
            shall allow the date product manufacturer an opportunity to respond.
            In the event that a date product manufacturer&apos;s name has been
            removed from the list of approved date product manufacturers, a new
            application must be submitted to the committee and the applicant
            must await approval.

          , the assessment obligation of FP dates shall be based on the weight
          of the dates at the time of inspection and certification. However, if
          such dates are subsequently processed and packed within the area of
          production, the assessment obligation shall be adjusted to reflect any
          increase in weight and the obligation shall be placed on the handler
          agreeing to assume it.
