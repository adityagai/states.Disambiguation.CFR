             A participant or importer is not required to use a purchasing agent
            or shipping agent, or employ the services of any other agent,
            broker, consultant, or other representative (hereafter “agent”) in
            connection with arranging the purchase of agricultural commodities
            under title I of the Act and arranging ocean transportation for such
            commodities. However, if an agent is used, the participant shall
            submit a written nomination of the agent to the Deputy
            Administrator, Export Credits, FAS, along with a copy of the
            proposed agreement between the participant or importer and such
            agent. The written nomination shall also specify the period of time
            to be covered by the nomination. A person may not act as agent for a
            participant or importer unless the Deputy Administrator, Export
            Credits, FAS, has provided a written statement that the nomination
            is accepted in accordance with the provisions of this section.

             Participants are encouraged to purchase commodities on the basis of

            commodity purchases are not made on the basis of lowest landed cost
            (U.S. flag), ocean freight differential payments will nonetheless be
            calculated on the rates of U.S. flag vessels which would represent
            the lowest landed cost.

             When CCC finances any part of the ocean freight or the ocean
            freight differential, the participant must open an operable
            irrevocable letter of credit for the portion of the ocean freight
            not financed by CCC. All banking institution charges, such as
            commissions, expenses, etc., are for the account of the participant.
            The amount of the letter of credit shall be computed using the
            information provided in the Form CCC-106. The letter of credit shall
            provide for sight payment or acceptance of a draft, payable in U.S.
            dollars, on the basis of the quantities specified in the applicable
            ocean freight contract. If the supplier of ocean transportation
            accepts the commodity before receipt of an acceptable letter of
            credit from a bank, the supplier takes such action at its own risk.
            This action in itself does not affect eligibility for CCC financing.

             Ocean freight contracts must show the ocean freight rate from one

            in rate for an additional port of loading or discharge, or other
            option. CCC, however, will finance initially the lowest such rate or
            OFD, as appropriate. Increased amounts due because of the exercise
            of such option will be financed only after receipt of an ocean bill
            of lading or other evidence showing that the option was exercised.

             Ocean freight contracts must specify that the participant shall be
            liable for detention of the vessel for loading delays attributable
            solely to the decision of the supplier of ocean transportation not

            establish an ocean freight letter of credit in accordance with
            paragraph (a)(5) of this section. However, ocean freight contracts
            may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean transportation

            all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar
            day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such
            delay shall not commence earlier than upon presentation of the
            vessel at the designated loading port within the laydays specified
            in the ocean freight contract, and upon notification of the
            vessel&apos;s readiness to load in accordance with the terms of the
            applicable ocean freight contract. The period of such delay shall
            end at the time that operable irrevocable letters of credit have
            been established for the applicable ocean freight or the time the
            vessel begins loading, whichever is earlier. Time calculated as
            detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such
            detention shall be payable no later than upon the vessel&apos;s
            arrival at the first port of discharge.

            price or the ocean freight or ocean freight differential to be
