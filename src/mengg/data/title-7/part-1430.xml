             A dairy operation that enters into a MILC contract with CCC must
            designate the starting month for each fiscal year for the
            calculation of payments and pound limits for the operation. Once a
            start month is chosen for a fiscal year the corresponding month will
            be the start month for each subsequent fiscal year unless changed by
            an affirmative request in writing on a form approved by CCC. The
            production start month must be selected on or before the 14th of the
            month before the month for which payment is sought. If such date
            falls on a weekend, the start month selection must be made on the
            last business day preceding the weekend. A dairy operation cannot
            select as the start month for payment a month which:

             All producers involved in the dairy operation must agree to the
            month designated. The dairy operation assumes the risk of not
            reaching the maximum payment quantity based on the month selected by
            the dairy operation. Payments will not be issued for past months for
            the sole purpose of reaching the maximum payment quantity.

             The payment rate as calculated as specified in paragraph (b) of
            this section, will be adjusted to compensate for feed prices when
            the National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost for a month is greater
            than the levels set in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
            The National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost per cwt. for each month
            will be calculated using the same procedures used to calculate the
            feed components of the estimated price of 16 percent Mixed Dairy
            Feed per pound noted on page 33 of the USDA monthly Agricultural
            Prices publication (including the data and factors noted in footnote
            4). The payment rate adjustment for Entire Month feed prices will be
            determined by increasing $16.94 by the percentage that is 45 percent
            of the percentage by which the National Average Dairy Feed Ration
            Cost exceeds $7.35 per cwt. (except that $7.35 will be $9.50 for
            September 2012 marketings.)

             A dairy operation entering into a MILC must, based on instructions
            issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof of the
            dairy operation&apos;s eligible production during the months of each
            fiscal year designated in the MILC. The dairy operation must also
            provide proof that the eligible production was commercially marketed
            during the months beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September
            30, 2012. Evidence of milk production claimed for payment shall be
            provided to CCC with supporting documentation under paragraph (b) of
            this section. All information provided is subject to verification,
            spot check and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be

            information. Refusal to allow a representative of CCC or any other
            agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information
            provided will result in a determination of ineligibility for
            benefits under this subpart.

            specified in the MILC shall provide any available supporting

            verifying that the dairy operation produced and marketed milk
            commercially from the designated starting month and thereafter.
            Examples of supporting documentation include, but are not limited
            to: milk marketing payment stubs, tank records, milk handler
            records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received as
            compensation from other sources, or any other documents available to
            confirm the production and production history of the dairy
            operation. Producers may also be required to allow CCC to examine
            the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting
            documentation requested is not presented to CCC or FSA, the request
            for MILC benefits will be disapproved.

             A dairy operation receiving MILC benefits may reorganize or
            restructure such that the constitution or makeup of its operation is
            reconstituted in another organizational framework. However, any
            operation that reorganizes or restructures after October 1, 2007, is
            subject to a review by FSA to determine if the operation was
            reorganized or restructured for the sole purpose of receiving
            multiple or additional MILC payments.

             Calculated production losses may be adjusted by FSA based on the
            monthly average of daily dairy cow additions or reductions to the
            milking herd during the period of July 1, 2004 through October 31,
            2004, to account for production adjustments as a result of dairy cow
            purchases, sales, or death losses. Production adjustments can be
            calculated using the average number of dairy cows in a dairy
            operation&apos;s milking herd and the average production per cow
            during each applicable month. Per-cow production averages during the
            months of August through October will be determined based on the
            actual per-cow production average during the month of July 2004 and
            reduced downward according to the seasonal decline percentages
            provided in paragraph (a) of this section, to determine the total

            certify with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of the
            information provided in their application for benefits. All
            information provided is subject to verification and spot checks by
            CCC. Refusal to allow CCC or any other agency of the Department of
            Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a
            determination of ineligibility. Data furnished by the applicant will
            be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing
            the data is voluntary; however, without it program benefits will not
            be approved. Providing a false certification to the Government is
            punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties.

             Subject to the availability of funds, each eligible dairy
            operation&apos;s payment is calculated by multiplying the applicable
            payment rate under paragraph (a) of this section by the
            operation&apos;s total eligible losses. Where there are multiple
            producers in the dairy operation, individual producers&apos;
            payments are disbursed according to each producer&apos;s share of
            the dairy operation&apos;s production as specified in the
            Application.

             If the total value of losses claimed under paragraph (b) of this
            section exceeds the $17 million available for DDAP-II, less any
            reserve that may be created under paragraph (e) of this section,
            total eligible losses of individual dairy operations that, as
            calculated as an overall percentage for the full disaster claim
            period that corresponds with the applicable hurricane-related
            disaster (not a monthly average for any one month), are greater than
            20 percent of the total base production for those applicable claim
            period months will be paid at the maximum rate under paragraph (a)
            of this section to the extent available funding allows. A loss of
            over 20 percent in only one or two of the eligible months does not
            itself qualify for the maximum per-pound payment. Total eligible
            losses for a producer, as calculated under

              § 1430.606, of

             less than or equal to 20 percent during the eligible claim period
            will then be paid at a rate determined by dividing the eligible
            losses of less than 20 percent by the funds remaining after making
            payments for all eligible losses above the 20-percent threshold.
