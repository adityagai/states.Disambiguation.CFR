             Payment of salaries and necessary employee benefits of personnel as
            agreed upon in the Cooperative Agreement. Included are salaries and
            benefits of State employees assigned full-time to one or more
            projects, or the percent of the salaries and benefits related to
            project work for State employees assigned part-time to research on
            one or more projects. Salaries and benefits include basic salary,
            other compensation such as holiday pay, sick or annual leave, and
            personnel benefits (quarters allowance, payments to other funds such
            as employees&apos; life insurance, health benefits, retirement,
            Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), accident compensation,
            and similar payments). For any of the benefit items when the State
            usually pays the employer share, Federal funds may be used to pay
            the proportionate share of such employer contributions.

             Payment of necessary and reasonable office expenses such as office
            rental, office utilities, and office equipment rental. The purchase
            of office equipment is permissible when the cooperator determines it
            to be more economical than renting. However, as a general rule,
            these types of expenses would be classified as indirect costs in
            multiple funded organizations and would not be an allowable expense.
            Planned purchases of equipment costing more than $200 per unit must
            be approved by RDA or its successor agency. Equipment purchased
            becomes State property pursuant to the cooperative agreement.
