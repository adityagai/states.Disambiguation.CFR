            processing insured loans for Community Facilities except fire and
            rescue and other small essential community facility loans and water
            and waste disposal facilities. This subpart applies to Community
            Facilities loans for fire and rescue and other small essential
            community facility loans only as specifically provided for in
            subpart C of this part. Water and waste loans are provided for in

            making loans to assure maximum support to the State strategy for
            rural development. State Directors and their staffs shall maintain
            coordination and liaison with State agency and substate planning
            districts. Funds allocated for use under this subpart are also for
            the use of Indian tribes within the State, regardless of whether
            State development strategies include Indian reservations within the
            State&apos;s boundaries. Indians residing on such reservations must
            have equal opportunity to participate in the 
            <PRTPAGE P='117' />
            benefits of these programs as compared with other residents of the
            State. Federal statutes provide for extending Agency financial
            programs without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national
            origin, marital status, age, or physical/mental handicap. The
            participants must possess the capacity to enter into legal contracts
            under State and local statutes. Any processing or servicing activity
            conducted pursuant to this subpart involving authorized assistance
            to Agency employees, members of their families, known close
            relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to
            the provisions of subpart D of

          The State Director will, with assistance as necessary by the Office of
          the General Counsel (OGC), concur in agreements between borrowers and
          third parties such as contracts for professional and technical
          services and contracts for the purchase of water or treatment of
          waste. State Directors are expected to work closely with
          representatives of engineering and architectural societies, bar
          associations, commercial lenders, accountant associations, and others
          in developing standard forms of agreements, where needed, and other
          such matters in order to expedite application processing, minimize
          referrals to OGC, and resolve problems which may arise.

            statement concerning loan closing, the security instruments, and

            OGC) with the certification of the borrower&apos;s attorney, along
            with a statement by the State Director that all administrative
            requirements have been met, will be referred to OGC for post-closing

            opinion from OGC. When the opinion from OGC is received, the State
            Director will advise the District Director of any deficiencies that
            must be corrected and return all material that was submitted for
            review.

             Each borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves
            sufficient to assure that loan installments will be paid on time,
            for emergency maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for
            replacement of short-lived assets which have a useful life
            significantly less than the repayment period of the loan. It is
            expected that borrowers issuing bonds or other evidences of debt
            pledging facility revenues as security will ordinarily plan their
            reserve to provide for a total reserve in an amount at least equal
            to one average loan installment. It is also expected the ordinarily
            such reserve will be accumulated at the rate of at least one-tenth
            of the total each year until the desired level is reached.

             Owners are encouraged to accomplish construction through contracts
            with recognized contractors. Owners may accomplish construction by
            using their own personnel and equipment provided the owners possess
            the necessary skills, abilities and resources to perform the work
            and provided a licensed engineer or architect prepares design
            drawings and specifications and inspects construction and furnishes
            inspection reports as required by paragraph (o) of this section. For
            other than utility-type facilities, inspection services may be

             The Design/Build method of construction is one in which the
            architectural and engineering services, normally provided by an
            independent consultant to the owner, are combined with those of the
            General Contractor under a single source contract. These services

            between an architectural firm and a construction firm, or a company
            providing pre-engineered buildings and design services.

             The Construction Management/constructor (CMc), acts in the capacity

            <PRTPAGE P='168' />
            also referred to as Construction Manager “At Risk.” The construction
            contract is between the owner and the CMc. The CMc, in turn, may
            subcontract for some or all of the work.

             The National Office may approve other alternative contact methods,
            such as Construction Management/advisor (CMa), with a recommendation
            from the State Office. The recommendation shall indicate the
            circumstances which prove this method advantageous to the applicant
            and the Government. A CMa acts in an advisory capacity to the owner,
            and the actual contract for construction is between the owner and a
            prime contractor or multiple prime contractors. When a contract for
            an architect and a CMa are being provided, it is important to make
            sure that separate professionals are not being paid to provide
            similar services. Further, paragraph (e)(3) of this section
            discourages separate contracts for construction.

             In all contracts for construction or facility improvements awarded
            exceeding $100,000, the owner shall require bonds, a bank letter of
            credit or cash deposit in escrow assuring performance and payment,
            each in the amount of 100 percent of the contract cost. The surety
            will normally be in the form of performance bonds and payment bonds;
            however, when other methods of surety may be necessary, bid
            documents must contain provisions for such alternative types of
            surety. The use of surety other than performance bonds and payment
            bonds requires concurrence by the National Office after submission
            of a justification by the State Director together with the proposed
            form of escrow agreement or letter of credit. For contracts of
            lesser amounts, the owner may require surety. When a surety is not
            provided, contractors will furnish evidence of payment in full for

            payment is deferred, no attempt should be made to compute in dollar
            terms the amount of interest due on these installment dates. Rather
            the instrument should provide that “interest only” is due on these

            the Local or Area Rural Development Office. When practical, approval
            officials should meet with prospective applicants before an
            application is filed to discuss eligibility and Rural Development
            requirements and processing procedures. Throughout loan processing,
            Rural Development should confer with applicant officials as needed
            to ensure that applicant officials understand the current status of
            the processing of their application, what steps and determinations
            are necessary, and what is required from them. Rural Development
            should assist the applicant as needed and generally try to develop
            and maintain a cooperative working relationship with the applicant.

             The State Office must monitor fire and rescue and other small
            community facility project loanmaking and servicing and provide
            guidance, assistance, and training as necessary to ensure the
            activities are accomplished in an orderly manner consistent with the
            Agency&apos;s regulations. The processing office should request
            advice and assistance from the State Office as needed. The State
            Director may require all or part of a specific application docket to
            be submitted to the State Office for review at any time. The State
            Director may determine that one or more of the processing office
            staffs do not have adequate training and expertise to routinely
            complete application dockets without State Office review. In such
            cases, the State Director should establish guidelines by memorandum
            or by State supplement to the subpart for the necessary State Office
            reviews.

             When a project is jointly financed, the District Director will
            reach any needed agreement or understanding with the representatives
            of the other source of funds on distribution of responsibilities for
            handling various aspects of the project. These responsibilities will
            include supervision of construction, inspections and determination
            of compliance with appropriate regulations concerning equal
            employment opportunities, wage rates, nondiscrimination in making
            services or benefits available, and environmental compliance. If any
            problems develop which cannot be resolved locally, complete
            information should be sent to the State Office for advice.

        <P>
          The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any
          requirement or provision of this subpart which is not inconsistent
          with the authorizing statute, an applicable law or decision of the
          Comptroller General, if the Administrator determines that application
          of the requirement or provision would adversely affect the
          Government&apos;s interest and show how the adverse impact will be
          eliminated or minimized if the exception is made.
