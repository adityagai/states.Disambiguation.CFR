             CCC may, on demand, call all outstanding CCC loans made to a

            pledged as collateral for loans must be repaid by the date specified
            by CCC. If redemption is not made by the date specified, title to
            the commodity shall vest in CCC and CCC shall have no obligation to
            pay the 
            <PRTPAGE P='607' />

            producer has certified to the CMA the commodity is eligible. In

            interest from the date of receiving the market gain through the
