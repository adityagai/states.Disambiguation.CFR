           means grapes of any variety grown in the area, from which a
          significant part of the natural moisture has been removed by
          sun-drying or artificial dehydration, either prior to or after such
          grapes have been removed from the vines. Removal of a significant part
          of the natural moisture means removal which has progressed to the
          point where the grape skin develops wrinkles characteristic of
          wrinkles in fully formed raisins.

            relating to the quantity of raisins of all varietal types. For any
            varietal type for which a free tonnage percentage may be
            recommended, the Committee shall compute a trade demand. The trade
            demand shall be 90 percent of the prior crop year&apos;s shipments
            (converted to a natural condition weight) of free tonnage and
            reserve tonnage sold for free use for that varietal type, into all
            market outlets, adjusted by the carryin on August 1 of the current
            crop year and the desirable carryout for the varietal type at the
            end of that crop year. If the prior year&apos;s shipments were
            limited because of crop conditions, the Committee may select the
            shipments of one of the three years preceding the prior crop year.
            The desirable carryout shall be increased from 45,000 to 60,000 tons
            for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins at a rate of 5,000 tons per
            year for three crop years following the effective date of this
            amended subpart. The desirable carryout for Dipped Seedless raisins
            shall be 1,500 tons, and for Oleate and Related Seedless raisins,
            1,500 tons. The trade demand computed by the Committee shall be
            announced by the

            crop year, the Committee shall make two simultaneous offers of
            reserve tonnage to handlers to sell as free tonnage for each
            varietal type for which preliminary percentages have been computed
            and announced. One offer shall consist of a quantity equal to 10
            percent of the prior year&apos;s (or the alternative year selected
            by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section)
            shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage sold for free use into
            all market outlets to equate the current year&apos;s supply with the
            prior year&apos;s shipments. This offer shall be allocated to
            handlers on the basis of their prior year&apos;s acquisitions. The
            second offer, to provide for market expansion, shall consist of a
            quantity equal to 10 percent of the prior year&apos;s (or the
            alternative year selected by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (a)
            of this section) shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage sold
            for free use. This offer shall be allocated to handlers on the basis
            of their prior year&apos;s shipments of free tonnage and reserve
            tonnage sold for free use. Each offer shall be open to handlers not
            more than five business days, and subsequently, two offers of any
            tonnage unsold in the original offers open not more than two
            business days each, may be made. The reoffer tonnage shall be
            allocated to handlers who purchase 100 percent of their allocation
            in preceding offers, and shall be on the basis of the quantity each
            handler purchased, as a percentage of the total quantity purchased
            by all handlers eligible to participate. At the close of the second
            reoffer, any remaining tonnage may be offered to handlers who
            purchased all of their allocations from previous offers on a
            first-come first-served basis and such offer shall be open to
            handlers for one business day. Any handler who had no shipments or
            acquisitions of raisins during the prior crop year will be allocated
            raisins under these offers on the basis of his acquisition (up to
            the time the original offer is made) of raisins in the current crop
            year. If field prices are not established, the offer shall be made
            not more than fifteen days following such establishment. The price
            of reserve tonnage raisins offered to handlers to sell as free
            tonnage, pursuant to this paragraph, shall be the established field
            price for free tonnage raisins of that varietal type, plus 3 percent
            of the established field price, plus the estimated costs incurred by
            the Committee for equity holders.

          Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendation and supporting
          information supplied by the Committee or from other available
          information, that to designate final free and reserve percentages for
          any varietal type of standard raisins acquired by handlers, during the
          crop year will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, the
          Secretary shall designate such percentages. In the event the Secretary
          finds that suspension or termination of any percentages computed by
          the Committee or designated by the Secretary tend to effectuate the
          declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall suspend or terminate
          such percentages.

             On or before November 30 of each crop year, the committee shall
            hold a meeting to review production data, supply data, demand data,
            including anticipated demand to all potential market outlets,
            desirable carryout inventory, and other matters relating to the
            quantity of raisins of all varietal types. When the committee
            determines that raisins exist in the reserve pool in excess of
            projected market needs for any varietal type, it may announce the
            amount of such tonnage eligible for diversion during the subsequent
            crop year. At the same time, the committee shall determine and
            announce to producers, handlers, and the cooperative bargaining
            association(s) the allowable harvest cost to be applicable to such
            diversion tonnage. A production cap of 2.75 tons of raisins per acre
            shall be established for any production unit approved for
            participation in a diversion program. The committee, with the
            approval of the Secretary, may recommend, at the same time that the
            diversion tonnage for that season is announced, a change in the
            production cap for that season&apos;s diversion program of less than
            2.75 tons per acre for any production unit approved for the
            diversion program.

             After the committee announces a raisin diversion program, any

            only be submitted by producers to handlers in accordance with
            applicable rules and regulations. Diversion certificates issued by
            the committee shall apply to a specific production unit and shall be
            equal to the creditable fruit weight, not to exceed the production
            cap established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, of such
            raisins produced on such unit during the prior crop year or the last
            prior crop year eligible for such diversion:

            certificate in an amount greater than the creditable fruit weight of
            the raisins produced therein or the production cap applicable.

            unstemmed to the person tendering the raisins; or (iii) be received

            handler under any one of the three described categories may be
            changed to any other of the categories under such rules and

             Handlers shall be compensated for receiving, storing, fumigating,
            handling, and inspection of that tonnage of reserve raisins
            determined by the reserve percentage of a crop year and held by them
            for the account of the committee, in accordance with a schedule of
            payments established by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
            A box rental shall be paid by the committee to producers or handlers
            for boxes used in storing reserve tonnage raisins beyond the crop
            year of acquisition in accordance with a rental schedule established
            by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The handler
            compensation shall be reviewed annually and shall be paid, as to the
            amount determined to be earned and unpaid, as soon as practicable
            after the end of the second quarter of the crop year and quarterly
            thereafter. Any handler may request the committee, by registered or
            certified mail, at any time after June 1 of a crop year to remove or
            relocate reserve tonnage raisins of the current crop year which
            remain in his possession. At any time during a crop year, a handler
            may request removal or relocation of reserve tonnage of a prior crop
            year. In each instance, he may request that the committee provide
            the necessary containers for any such removal or relocation. When so
            requested as to current crop year raisins, the committee shall make
            the removal or relocation, the availability of containers, storage
            space and time of request permitting, by September 15 of the
            subsequent crop year, and as to raisins of the prior crop year,
            within 30 days, supplying the necessary containers if so requested.
            If the committee removes or relocates reserve raisins of the current
            crop year pursuant to a handler&apos;s request, and such raisins are
            released to him by September 15 of the subsequent crop year, the
            handler shall reimburse the committee for any costs incurred by it
            in such removal or relocation. If any handler requests removal or
            relocation of reserve raisins, the committee shall immediately give
            notice thereof to the Secretary.

             At the time the committee meets to consider free and reserve
            percentages for a crop year, the committee shall consider the
            marketing of reserve tonnage raisins for the subsequent 12-month

            manner as to achieve, as nearly as may be practicable, maximum
            disposal of such raisins by the time reserve tonnage raisins from
            the subsequent crop year are available. Any reserve tonnage raisins
            held unsold by the committee on May 1 of the subsequent crop year
            shall be physically disposed of promptly in any available outlet not

            disposition of such raisins by the time reserve tonnage raisins from

            not to exceed 2 percent of the total tonnage offered in such offer

            offer or reoffer of reserve tonnage raisins. No offer or reoffer
            shall be made until 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and
            holidays) have elapsed from the time it files with the Secretary
            complete information as to varietal type, quantity, and price
            involved in such offer or reoffer, and the Secretary may disapprove
            the offer or reoffer or any term thereof:

            of such offer or reoffer, the committee may withdraw an offer or
            reoffer to sell reserve tonnage raisins to handlers or may extend
            the offer or reoffer period but not when such extension would
            deprive one or more handlers of an opportunity to purchase raisins.

            shall be reduced by the percentage such removed reserve tonnage is
            of the total reserve tonnage acquired by such handler in the crop

            free tonnage raisins acquired by the handler during the then current
            crop year is of the total free tonnage raisins acquired by all
            handlers during the then current crop year. With respect to any

            shall, for the purposes of determining the shares of all handlers
            prior to November 1, be added to the total acquisitions of free
            tonnage raisins during the preceding crop

          member position and one vote for a nominee for each producer alternate
          member position on the committee which is to be filled for his

          thereon; (b) rents and farms land, resulting in his or its ownership

          land is leased on a cash rental basis, only the person who is the

            occur on vines in an approved production unit shall be removed and
            destroyed by the applicant before maturity. If the Committee
            representatives or agents determine that there is an average of more

            the producer shall be notified immediately by certified mail, in
            writing, and given 2 weeks to remove such bunches. Grafting vines of
            one varietal type to another varietal type does not constitute
            removal of vines under the program.

             For the purpose of the raisin diversion program, a production unit
            is a clearly defined geographic area with permanent boundaries
            (either natural or man-made). A producer must be able to document to
            the Committee the previous year&apos;s production data for that
            specific area by means of sales receipts or other deliveries or
            transfer documents which indicate the creditable fruit weight
            delivered to handlers from that specific area. If the information
            submitted by producers on the application concerning a unit&apos;s
            production is significantly greater than past production on the
            unit, production on neighboring units, or the industry norm, or the
            production is unable to be verified based on submitted
            documentation, the Committee may request additional documentation
            such as tray count, payroll records, prior years&apos; production,
            and insurance records to substantiate the tonnage of raisins
            produced on all production units that such applicant controls or
            owns. Producers would not be precluded from submitting other
            information substantiating production if those producers desired. A
            new production unit will not be eligible for the raisin diversion
            program until at least 1 year&apos;s production has been grown and
            is documented. An existing production unit, transferred to a new or
            expanding producer, is eligible for the raisin diversion program as
            soon as the previous year&apos;s production can be properly
            documented.

             If any changes are made in the terms and conditions of the
            diversion program after a producer&apos;s application has been
            approved, the Committee will notify the producer of such changes and
            the producer will be given 10 calendar days to agree to the revised
            terms, or to withdraw from the program. Failure of the producer to
            notify the Committee in writing of its intention to withdraw from
            the program within 10 calendar days from the date of the
            Committee&apos;s notice will constitute agreement to the revised
            terms and conditions.

             The additional opportunity applies to production units on which
            producers agree to remove vines. The additional opportunity program
            applies to “new participants” (producers who are not approved
            participants in the initial 2002 diversion program), and to “early
            season spur pruners” (approved participants in the initial 2002
            diversion program who curtailed production by spur pruning their
            vines). Grafting vines of one varietal type to another varietal type
            does not constitute removal under the program.

            inspection points reasonably safe and adequate facilities for
            receiving raisins, drawing samples, and efficient inspection of
            natural condition raisins. At the time of inspection of any lot, the
            handler shall, at his expense, provide the inspector with any
            assistance necessary in the inspection of the raisins, including the
            movement of individual containers. Each handler, other than a
            processor, shall maintain with the Committee a current written

            each of his inspection points. In the event the Committee determines
            that any inspection point, or any modification thereof, does not

            shall notify the handler of the changes necessary for compliance.
            The handler shall make such changes promptly. In the event any of
            his inspection points is the same as that of another handler or
            person receiving raisins or grapes in any form, the handler shall
            maintain his raisins separate and apart from any other raisins.

             The weight of each lot of raisins tendered for receiving, storage,
            reconditioning, acquisition, or disposition shall be substantiated
            by an official “State Certificate of Weights and Measures” issued by
            a public weighmaster, whether located at the inspection point or
            otherwise, or such other document approved by the Committee which
            accurately reflects the weight of each lot tendered. The net weight
            of such raisins for the purposes of this part, shall be determined
            by deducting the sand tare and box tare from the gross weight of the
            raisins. The sand tare shall be the weight of the sand and other

            purpose) having 36 square openings to the square inch, with each

             For each lot of natural condition raisins received by a handler for
            acquisition, reconditioning, storage, inspection, or for disposition
            in eligible nonnormal outlets, the handler shall, immediately upon
            physical receipt and tentative acceptance thereof, issue a
            prenumbered (numbered serially in advance) door receipt or weight
            certificate showing the name and address of the tenderer, the weight
            of the lot, the number and type of containers in the lot, and any
            other information necessary to identify the lot. For the purposes of
            identifying incoming lots of raisins, other than dehydrated raisins
            covered by paragraph (e) of this section, a handler, if it is
            impracticable for him to issue immediately a door receipt or weight
            certificate, may issue for temporary use only a prenumbered “Request
            for USDA Inspection” on a form furnished by the Committee. Any such
            raisins so received by a handler shall, prior to their acceptance,
            be inspected at an inspection point during the unloading process,
            and if certified as standard raisins shall be, unless returned to
            the tenderer, either promptly acquired by the handler or received

            such absence is during normal business hours and the handler has a
            written statement from the inspection service to the effect that
            inspection cannot be furnished within a reasonable time:

            with respect to dehydrated raisins covered by paragraph (e) of this
            section, and furnish weight certificates promptly. Any raisins
            received by a handler as off-grade for disposition in eligible

            uninspected:

            the Inspection Service prior to, or upon physical receipt of, such
            off-grade raisins. Such form shall provide for at least the name and
            address of the tenderer (equity holder), date, number, and type of
            containers, net weight of the raisins, and the particular defect(s)
            the handler indicates would cause the raisins to be off-grade.
            Handlers shall complete and sign the form. The application for such
            uninspected raisins shall not be acceptable unless signed by the
            tenderer. The uninspected raisins shall be subject to surveillance
            by the Inspection Service. Each lot of raisins accepted by a handler
            for reconditioning shall be reconditioned separately from any other
            lot.

            become obligated (after any shrinkage allowances which may

            then be in effect are applied and allowances for any deterioration
            due to conditions beyond his control are made) shall compensate the
            Committee for the amount of the loss resulting from his failure to
            so deliver. The amount of compensation for any shortage of tonnage
            shall be determined by multiplying the quantity of reserve raisins
            not delivered by the latest weighted average price per ton received
            by producers during the particular crop year for free tonnage
            raisins of the same varietal type or types, plus any charges already
            paid or credited to the handler and cost incurred by the Committee
            on account of the handler&apos;s failure to deliver. The weighted
            average price shall be determined from those sales made during the
            particular crop year up to the time such cash payment is requested
            by the Committee, or up to the end of the particular crop year,
            whichever date may be earlier. The amount which a handler shall
            compensate the Committee for any reserve raisins which have
            deteriorated so as to be off-grade in quality during storage for
            reasons within his control, shall be the latest weighted average
            price received by the Committee for the applicable varietal type of
            reserve pool raisins, less the amount actually received by the
            Committee in the disposition of the deteriorated raisins delivered
            by the handler (or the salvage value of such raisins as determined
            by the Committee). Any amounts paid to the Committee in satisfaction
            of such deficiencies shall accrue to the earnings of the applicable
            reserve pool. The remedies provided in this paragraph shall be in
            addition to, and not exclusive of, any or all of the remedies or
            penalties prescribed in the act for failure on the part of the
            handler to comply with the applicable provisions of the act or of
            this part.

             Whenever the Committee offers reserve tonnage raisins to handlers
            for sale in export, it shall specify in addition to the normal
            contract terms and conditions, the total quantity, the price and
            period within which each handler will be permitted to purchase his
            share of the offer. Whenever a handler&apos;s share of an offer is
            less than, or exceeds, his holding of reserve tonnage raisins by not
            more than 10 tons, the Committee may adjust his share so as to avoid
            the cost involved in the physical transfer of raisins. If, prior to
            the expiration of the offer period, a handler desires to obtain
            reserve tonnage in an amount greater than that represented by his
            share of the offer, he may negotiate with another handler for any
            unpurchased portion of the other handler&apos;s share of an
            outstanding offer. No such transaction shall be deemed to reduce the
            transferring handler&apos;s share or to increase the transferee
            handler&apos;s share so as to affect either handler&apos;s share
            privileges in subsequent offers. Transfers to implement such
            transactions between handlers shall be permitted by the Committee
            only upon receipt of written authorization, on a form furnished by
            the Committee, by the transferring handler. All limitations
            applicable to the transferred tonnage shall continue to apply. Such
            reserve tonnage raisins will be released by the Committee to the
            transferee handler upon submission of his completed application and
            full payment for such raisins, and such transferee handler shall be
            responsible to the Committee for all documentation required in
            connection with the transaction. All such transfers shall be made at
            the expense of the handlers concerned.

            price of free tonnage packed raisins. In such an event, or if there
            is no current field price, the Committee shall make any offer of
            reserve tonnage at approximately the computed field price obtained
            by deducting from the current f.o.b. price for free tonnage packed
            raisins of the varietal type to be offered, the approximate recent
            packing and handling margin between such packed price and the field
            price for free tonnage raisins. This paragraph (b) shall not be in
            effect from July 30, 1984, through July 31, 1986.

             Whenever the Committee offers reserve tonnage raisins to handlers
            for use in free tonnage outlets, the Committee shall, among other
            terms and conditions of the offer, specify (1) the period in which
            each handler shall be given the opportunity to purchase his share of
            the offer, and (2) the period in which each eligible handler shall
            be given an opportunity to purchase his respective share of any
            reoffer. In the event reserve pool raisins are transferred by the
            Committee, the purchasing handler shall promptly empty the raisins
            from the containers used in the transfer so that the Committee may
            return the containers and pallets used in the transfer to the
            handler from whom the raisins were transferred within 10 business
            days from the date of transfer. Any handler who refuses to permit
            the containers in which reserve pool raisins are stored to leave his
            premises, shall, at his expense, place such raisins in containers
            supplied by the Committee.

          be considered as standard raisins and those failing to meet such
          standards shall be considered as off-grade raisins. Where the raisins
          in any lot consist of two or more varietal types commingled within
          their containers, the lot shall be considered as a mixed lot and as
          standard raisins if they meet for each defect the most restrictive
          requirements for the varietal types of raisins comprising the lot. In
          the event layered Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or
          Cluster Seedless raisins are commingled within their containers with
          loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or loose Cluster
          Seedless raisins respectively, the entire lot shall be considered as
          loose Muscats (including other raisins with seeds) or Natural
          (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. The raisins shall be considered as
          standard raisins if the lot as a whole meets the minimum standards for

          shall be considered as meeting such requirements if they have been
          properly prepared as raisins. In each category, only those raisins
          which have been properly dried and cured in original natural
          condition, are free from active infestation, and are in such condition
          that they are capable of being received, stored, and packed without
          undue deterioration or spoilage, shall be considered as storable
          raisins.

          Members and employees of the Raisin Administrative Committee are
          immune from prosecution under the United States antitrust laws only
          insofar as their conduct in administering the Raisin Marketing Order
          is authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,

           et seq., or the provisions of the order. Under the antitrust laws.
          Committee members and 
          <PRTPAGE P='637' />
          employees may not engage in any unauthorized agreement or concerted
          action that unreasonably restrains United States domestic or foreign
          commerce. For example, Committee members and employees have no
          authority to participate, either directly or indirectly, whether on an
          informal or formal, written or oral basis, in any bilateral or
          international undertaking or agreement with any competing foreign
          producer or seller or with any foreign government, agency, or
          instrumentality acting on behalf of competing foreign producers or
          sellers to (a) raise, fix, stabilize, or set a floor for raisin,
          sultana, or currant prices, or (b) limit the quantity or quality of
          raisins, sultanas, or currants imported into or exported from the
          United States. Participation in any such unauthorized agreement or
          joint undertaking could result in prosecution under the antitrust laws
          by the United States Department of Justice and/or suit by injured
          private persons seeking treble damages, and could also result in
          expulsion of members from the Committee or termination of employment
          with the Committee.
