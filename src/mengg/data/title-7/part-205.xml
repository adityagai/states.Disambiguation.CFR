          <PRTPAGE P='434' />
          agent shall charge applicants for certification and certified
          production and handling operations only those fees and charges that it
          has filed with the Administrator. The certifying agent shall provide
          each applicant with an estimate of the total cost of certification and
          an estimate of the annual cost of updating the certification. The
          certifying agent may require applicants for certification to pay at
          the time of application a nonrefundable fee which shall be applied to
          the applicant&apos;s fees-for-service account. The certifying agent
          may set the nonrefundable portion of certification fees; however, the
          nonrefundable portion of certification fees must be explained in the
          fee schedule submitted to the Administrator. The fee schedule must
          explain what fee amounts are nonrefundable and at what stage during
          the certification process fees become nonrefundable. The certifying
          agent shall provide all persons inquiring about the application
          process with a copy of its fee schedule.

          certifying agent shall provide written notification to the applicant
          for certification or certified operation. The written notification
          shall advise the applicant for certification or certified operation of

          organic program is in effect, the mediation procedures established in
          the State organic program, as approved by the Secretary, will be
          followed. The parties to the mediation shall have no more than 30 days
          to reach an agreement following a mediation session. If mediation is
          unsuccessful, the applicant for certification or certified operation
          shall have 30 days from termination of mediation to appeal the
