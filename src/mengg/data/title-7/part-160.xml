          , rosin is the vitreous, well-strained, transparent, solid resin which
          (a) remains after the volatile terpene oils are distilled from (1) the
          oleoresin collected from living trees or (2) the oleoresin extracted
          from wood; or (b) remains after distillation of the fatty acids from
          tall oil recovered from wood in the course of its chemical
          disintegration to produce cellulose. In addition to the free resin
          acids, rosin may contain relatively small proportions of fatty acids,
          resin esters and other esters, unsaponifiable resenes, and
          non-resinous foreign matter naturally occurring therein.

          rosin undergoes internal modification indicated by a turbid, clouded,
          or opaque appearance, that is, loss of transparency, brought about by
          the occlusion of moisture or the formation of an excessive quantity of
          resin acid crystals in the rosin.

        <P>
          Before or after the shipment in commerce of any lot of rosin in drums
          from a processing or storage point, and upon request by an interested
          person, an inspection may be made by an official inspector of the
          external appearance of the drums, and a report may be made by such
          inspector, on the basis of such inspection, of the condition,
          including soundness, of the drums with reference to the effect thereof
          upon the quality, and preservation of the quality, of the rosin in the
          drums. In conjunction with such service, when practicable, the
          inspector may upon similar request determine and certify the grade,
          class, other quality, or condition of the rosin within the drums, and
          report the internal condition of the drums, under any applicable
          standards and procedural instructions issued to such inspector by the
          Administrator. Certificates and reports issued under this section will
          be furnished only to the interested person requesting the service.
          Fees and charges for service under this section shall be paid by such
          interested person in accordance with

          Illegible inspection marks.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          In case any mark placed on a container of rosin by or under the
          direction of an official inspector has become illegible, he will make
          such examination before remarking as may be necessary to establish the
          proper grade or identity of the rosin. No fee will be charged for this
          service, but the cost of handling, opening, spiking, and closing the
          container shall be borne by the interested person.

             A license to inspect, grade and certify naval stores may be
            summarily suspended or revoked by any official authorized to issue
            or countersign such licenses where the public health, interest, or
            safety so requires or for willful acts or omissions by the licensee
            which constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of his license
            under paragraph (a) of this section. In all other cases, prior to
            the institution of proceedings for the suspension or revocation of a
            license, such authorized official shall cause to be served upon the
            licensee, in person or by registered mail, a statement of the facts
            which appear to warrant such suspension or revocation, specifying a
            reasonable time, depending upon the circumstances in each case,
            within which the licensee may demonstrate or achieve compliance with
            the act, and the provisions in this part. The licensee may
            demonstrate compliance by the presentation of evidence in writing
            or, in the discretion of such authorized official, at an oral
            hearing. If, at the end of the time allowed for the licensee to
            demonstrate or achieve compliance, such authorized official finds he
            is in compliance, his license shall not be suspended or revoked. If
            such authorized official finds the licensee is not in compliance,
            the license may be suspended or revoked after service upon the
            licensee, in person or by registered mail, of a notice that such
            action is under consideration for reasons specified in the statement
            of facts previously served upon him and after reasonable opportunity
            is given the licensee to present further evidence in his behalf.
            Within 7 days after receipt of notice of the suspension or
            revocation of his license, the inspector by letter may appeal to the
            Administrator for its reinstatement and may attach to such letter
            any evidence he may wish to submit.

          Any claim remaining unpaid after 30 days from the date of its
          rendition shall be considered as delinquent, and notice thereof shall
          be brought to the attention of the interested person. After a claim
          becomes delinquent, the Administrator shall suspend or deny inspection
          and related services to any interested party who has failed to make
          timely payment of the fees and charges assessed, as well as any claims
          which have been rendered, and shall take such action as may be
          necessary to collect any amounts due. A deposit in advance sufficient
          to cover the fees and expenses for any subsequent service may be
          required of any person failing to pay his claim after issuance of such
          notice of delinquency.

            The analysis and testing of rosin involves many different types of
            laboratory procedures, requiring variable time for performance, and
            including other cost factors. The charge for such analysis and
            testing will depend on the type and extent of the work required to
            supply the information desired by the interested person requesting
            the service. When it appears that the charges indicated in this
            section will not defray the costs of making the tests required, the
            interested person shall be informed before any work is performed and
            will be supplied with a cost estimate of the actual charges to be
            made. See also
