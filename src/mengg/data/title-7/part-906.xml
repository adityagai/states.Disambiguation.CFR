          The committee may recommend, and pursuant thereto the Secretary may
          approve, the reapportionment of members among districts, the
          reapportionment of members between grower and handler members
          representing cooperative marketing organizations and independent
          grower and independent handler members, and the re-establishment of
          districts within the production area. In recommending such changes,
          the committee shall give consideration to: (a) Shifts in production;
          (b) the importance of new production in its relation to existing
          districts; (c) the equitable relationship of committee membership and
          districts; (d) changes in amount of fruit handled by cooperative
          marketing organizations in relation to 
          <PRTPAGE P='73' />
          fruit handled by independent handlers; and (e) other relevant factors.
          No changes in districting or in apportionment of members may become
          effective in less than 30 days prior to the date on which terms of
          office begin each year and no recommendations for such redistricting
          or reapportionment may be made less than six months prior to such
          date.

            representing cooperative marketing organizations may participate in

          the ratio between the total quantity of fruit handled by him as the
          first handler thereof during a fiscal period and the total quantity of
