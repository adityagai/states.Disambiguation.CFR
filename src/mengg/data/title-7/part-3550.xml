        <P>
          The purpose of the direct RHS single family housing loan programs is
          to provide low- and very low-income people who will live in rural
          areas with an opportunity to own adequate but modest, decent, safe,
          and sanitary dwellings and related facilities. The 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            section 502
          </aref>
           program offers persons who do not currently own adequate housing, and
          who cannot obtain other credit, the opportunity to acquire, build,
          rehabilitate, improve, or relocate dwellings in rural areas. The 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            section 504
          </aref>
           program offers loans to very low-income homeowners who cannot obtain
          other credit to repair or rehabilitate their properties. The 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            section 504
          </aref>
           program also offers grants to homeowners age 62 or older who cannot
          obtain a loan to correct health and safety hazards or to make the unit
          accessible to household members with disabilities.

            security property from a borrower, or security property at a
            foreclosure sale. Loan closing agents who have been involved with a
            particular property, as well as members of their families, are also
            precluded from purchasing such properties.

            that are expected to be received by those household members who are
            parties to the promissory note, except for any student financial aid
            received by these household members for tuition, fees, books,
            equipment, materials, and transportation. Repayment income is used
            to determine the household&apos;s ability to repay a loan.

            funding priorities specified in this paragraph. Within priority

            preference. After selection for processing, loans are funded on a

             A written lease is required. To be acceptable, a leasehold interest
            must have an unexpired term that is at least 150 percent of the term
            of the mortgage, unless the loan is guaranteed, in which case the
            unexpired term of the lease must be at least 2 years longer than the
            loan term. In no case may the unexpired term be less than 25 years.

             To be acceptable a life estate interest must provide the borrower

            other essential buildings in an amount equal to the insurable value
            of the dwelling and other essential buildings. However, in cases
            where the borrower&apos;s outstanding secured indebtedness is less

            not less than the outstanding secured indebtedness. If the borrower
            fails, or is unable, to insure the secured property, RHS will force

            coverage will generally be the property&apos;s last known insured

             An appraisal is required when the debt to be secured exceeds
            $15,000 or whenever RHS determines that it is necessary to establish
            the adequacy of the security. Appraisals must be made in accordance
            with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. When
            other real estate is taken as additional security, it will be
            appraised if it represents a substantial portion of the security for
            the loan.

          For qualified borrowers, RHS may defer up to 25 percent of the monthly
          principal and interest payment at 1 percent for up to 15 years. This
          assistance may be granted only at initial loan closing and is reviewed
          annually. Deferred mortgage payments are subject to recapture when the
          borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property.

          Conditional commitments.

        <P>
          A conditional commitment is a determination by RHS that a dwelling
          offered for sale will be acceptable for purchase by a qualified RHS
          loan applicant if it is built or rehabilitated in accordance with
          RHS-approved plans, specifications, and regulations and priced within
          the lesser of the property&apos;s appraised value or the applicable
          maximum load limit. The conditional commitment does not reserve funds,
          does not guarantee funding, and does not ensure that an eligible loan
          applicant will be available to buy the dwelling.

            other essential buildings in an amount equal to the insurable value
            of the dwelling and other essential buildings. However, in cases
            where the borrower&apos;s outstanding secured indebtedness is less

            buildings, the borrower may elect a lower coverage provided it is
            not less than the outstanding secured indebtedness. If the borrower
            fails, or is unable to insure the secured property, RHS will force
            place insurance and charge the cost to the borrower&apos;s account.
            Force place insurance only provides insurance coverage to the Agency
            and does not provide any direct coverage or benefit to the borrower.
            The amount of the lender-placed coverage generally will be the

             The borrower must notify RHS when he or she is no longer on active
            military duty. RHS will cancel the six percent interest rate and
            resume use of the promissory note interest rate. A new payment
            subsidy agreement may be processed if the borrower is eligible.

             Borrowers who wish to lease mineral rights to a security property
            must request authorization from RHS. RHS may consent to the lease of
            mineral rights and subordinate its liens to the lessee&apos;s rights
            and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will
            remain suitable as a residence and the Government&apos;s security
            interest will not be adversely affected. Subordination of RHS loans
            to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds
            from the sale of the security property.

            applied to reduce principal and the rent to be paid is at least
            equal to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security.

             RHS direct loan programs are not intended to supplant or compete
            with private credit sources. Therefore, borrowers are required to
            refinance RHS loans with private credit sources when RHS determines

             Borrowers must refinance with private credit when RHS determines
            that the borrower has the ability to obtain other credit at
            reasonable rates and terms based on their income, assets, and credit
            history. Reasonable rates and terms are those commercial rates and
            terms that borrowers are expected to meet when borrowing for similar
            purposes. Differences in interest rates and terms between RHS and
            other lenders will not be an acceptable reason for a borrower to
            fail to refinance with private credit if the available rates and
            terms are within the borrower&apos;s ability to pay.

             Borrowers with loans approved or assumed on or after October 1,
            1979, will be required to repay subsidy amounts received through
            payment subsidy (including the former interest credit program) or
            deferred mortgage assistance in accordance with paragraph (b) of
            this section. Amounts to be recaptured are due and payable when the
            borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property, including
            but not limited to, in the event of foreclosure or deed in lieu of
            foreclosure. Such recapture will include the amount of principal
            reduction attributed to subsidy (for loans subject to recapture that
            were approved, and received interest credit, between October 1,
            1979, and December 31, 1989), except in cases of foreclosure and
            deed in lieu of foreclosure.

             Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount to be
            recaptured in a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is the
            amount of subsidy received, not including any principal reduction
            attributed to subsidy. Foreclosure actions will seek to recover such
            amounts only from the proceeds of the property. Liquidation proceeds
            (in the case of foreclosure) or the net recovery value (in the case
            of deed in lieu of foreclosure) will be applied or credited to the

             If the borrower refinances or otherwise pays in full without
            transfer of title and continues to occupy the property, the amount
            of recapture will be calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of
            this section but payment of recapture may be deferred, interest
            free, until the property is sold or vacated. If the recapture amount
            is deferred, the Agency mortgage can be subordinated when in the
            Government&apos;s best interest but will not be released nor the
            promissory note satisfied until the Agency is paid in full. In
            situations where deferral of recapture is an option, recapture will
            be discounted if paid in full at the time of settlement or timely
            paid after Agency notification to the borrower that recapture is
            due.

          Purpose of special servicing actions.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          The Rural Housing Service (RHS) may approve special servicing actions
          to reduce the number of borrower failures that result in liquidation.
          Borrowers who have difficulty keeping their accounts current may be
          eligible for one or more available servicing options including:
          payment assistance; delinquency workout agreements that temporarily
          modify payment terms; protective advances of funds for taxes,
          insurance, and other approved costs; payment moratoriums; and
          reamortization of the loan.

             When RHS determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet
            loan obligations, RHS may accelerate the loan and, if necessary,
            acquire the security property. The borrower is responsible for all
            expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition. If the account
            is satisfied in full, the borrower will be released from liability.
            If the account is not satisfied in full, RHS may pursue any
            deficiency unless the borrower received a moratorium at any time
            during the life of the loan and faithfully tried to repay the loan.

             RHS may take custodial possession of security property that has
            been abandoned, or for other reasons necessary to protect the
            Government&apos;s security. After taking custodial possession of a
            security property, RHS may maintain and repair the security property
            as needed to protect the Government&apos;s interest, pay required
            real estate taxes and assessments, and secure personal property left
            on the premises. Expenses will be charged to the borrower&apos;s
            account. Custodial property may be leased when it is in the
            Government&apos;s best interest and in such cases the
            borrower&apos;s account will be credited for income from the
            security property.

             When a nonprofit organization or public body notifies RHS in
            writing of its intent to buy an REO property to provide transitional
            housing for the homeless, RHS may withdraw the property from the
            market for up to 30 days to give the entity an opportunity to
            execute a purchase contract. The listed price may be discounted for
            offers on a nonprogram REO property at any time, and on a program
            REO property after the 60-day reservation period. No down payment is
            required, and the loan term will be for a maximum of 30 years. Until
            RHS executes a sales agreement, an offer from a program-eligible
            applicant will receive priority, regardless of a nonprofit&apos;s
            interest in purchasing the REO property for use as transitional
