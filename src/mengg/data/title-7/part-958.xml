            the same meaning as defined in the United States Standards for
            Grades of Onions (Other than Bermuda Granex-Grano and Creole Types),
            as amended (
            <aref type='CFR'>

             through 51.2854), or the United States Standards for Grades of
            Bermuda-Granex-Grano Type Onions (
            <aref type='CFR'>

             through 51.3209), as amended, whichever is applicable to the
            particular variety, or variations thereof specified in this section.
            The term “braided red onions” means onions of red varieties with
            tops braided (interlaced). “Pearl onions” means onions produced
            using specific cultural practices that limit growth to 
            <PRTPAGE P='405' />
            the same general size as boilers and picklers (defined in the United
            States Standards specified in this paragraph), and that have been
            inspected and certified as measuring 2 inches in diameter or less.
            The term “moderately cured” means the onions are mature and are more
            nearly well cured than fairly well cured. Other terms used in this
            section have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement
            No. 130 and this part.
