            (those capable of working but who have dropped out of the labor

             General distress shall be evidenced by describing adverse
            conditions within the nominated area other than those of pervasive
            poverty and unemployment. Below average or decline in per capita
            income, earnings per worker, per capita property tax base, average
            years of school completed; outmigration and population decline, a
            high or rising incidence of crime, narcotics use, abandoned housing,
            deteriorated infrastructure, school dropouts, teen pregnancy,
            incidents of domestic violence, incidence of certain health
            conditions and illiteracy are examples of appropriate indicators of
            general distress. The data and methods used to produce such
            indicators that are used to describe general distress must all be
            stated.

          The strategic plan will be evaluated for effectiveness as part of the
          designation process for nominated rural areas described in subpart D
          of this part. On the basis of this evaluation, USDA may request
          additional information pertaining to the plan and the proposed area
          and may, as part of that request, suggest modifications to the plan,
          proposed area, or term that would enhance its effectiveness. The
          effectiveness of the strategic plan will be determined in accordance
