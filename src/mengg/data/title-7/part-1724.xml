          The standard loan agreement between RUS and its borrowers provides
          that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter,
          the borrower shall use standard forms of contracts promulgated by RUS
          for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural
          services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS. This part
          implements these provisions of the RUS loan agreement. Subparts A
          through E of this part prescribe when and how borrowers are required
          to use RUS standard forms of contracts for engineering and
          architectural services. Subpart F of this part 
          <PRTPAGE P='232' />
          prescribes the procedures that RUS follows in promulgating standard
          contract forms and identifies those contract forms that borrowers are
          required to use for engineering and architectural services.

          Borrowers shall have ongoing, integrated planning to determine their
          short-term and long-term needs for plant additions, improvements,
          replacements, and retirements for their electric systems. The primary
          components of the planning system consist of long-range engineering
          plans and construction work plans. Long-range engineering plans
          identify plant investments required over a long-range period, 10 years
          or more. Construction work plans specify and document plant
          requirements for a shorter term, 2 to 4 years. Long-range engineering
          plans and construction work plans shall be in accordance with
