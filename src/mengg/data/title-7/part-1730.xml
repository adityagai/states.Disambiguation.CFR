          utility practice, in compliance with its loan documents, and in
          compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and orders, shall
          maintain its systems in good repair, working order and condition, and
          shall make all needed repairs, renewals, replacements, alterations,
          additions, betterments and improvements, in accordance with applicable
          provisions of the borrower&apos;s security instrument. Each borrower
          is responsible for on-going operations and maintenance programs,
          individually or regionally performing a system security Vulnerability
          and Risk Assessment (VRA), establishing and maintaining an Emergency
          Restoration Plan (ERP), maintaining records of the physical, cyber and
          electrical condition and security of its electric system and for the
          quality of services provided to its customers. The borrower is also
          responsible for all necessary inspections and tests of the component
          parts of its system, and for maintaining records of such inspections
          and tests. Each borrower shall budget sufficient resources to operate
          and maintain its system and annually exercise its ERP in accordance
          with the requirements of this part. An actual manmade or natural event
          on the borrowers system in which a borrower utilizes a significant
          portion of its ERP shall count as an annual exercise for that calendar
          year, provided that after conclusion of the event, the borrower
          verifies accuracy of the emergency points-of-contact (POC) and the
          associated contact numbers as listed in their ERP. For portions of the
          borrower&apos;s system that are not operated by the borrower, if any,
          the borrower is responsible for ensuring that the operator is
          operating and maintaining the system properly in accordance with the
          operating agreement.

             Each borrower shall conduct all necessary inspections and tests of
            the component parts of its electric system, annually exercise its
            ERP, and maintain records of such inspections and tests. For the
            purpose of this part, “Exercise” means a borrower&apos;s Tabletop
            execution of, or actual implementation of, the ERP to verify the
            operability of the ERP. Such Exercise may be performed singly by an
            individual borrower, or as an active participant in a multi-party
            (to include utilities, government agencies and other participants or
            combination thereof) Tabletop execution or actual full
            implementation of the ERP. For the purpose of this part, “Tabletop”
            means a hypothetical emergency response scenario in which
            participants will identify the policy, communication, resources,
            data, coordination, and organizational elements associated with an
            emergency response.

             The frequency of inspection and testing will be determined by the
            borrower in conformance with applicable laws, regulations, national
            standards, and Prudent Utility Practice. The frequency of inspection
            and testing will be determined giving due consideration to the type
            of facilities or equipment, manufacturer&apos;s recommendations,
            age, operating environment and hazards to which the facilities are
            exposed, consequences of failure, and results of previous
            inspections and tests. The records of such inspections and tests
            will be retained in accordance with applicable regulatory
            requirements and Prudent Utility Practice. The retention period
            should be of a sufficient time period to identify long-term trends.
            Records must be retained at least until the applicable inspections
            or tests are repeated.

            transmission grid, consists of a network of electrical lines and
            related facilities, including certain substations, used to connect
            distribution facilities to generation facilities, and includes bulk
            transmission and subtransmission facilities as defined in

          operations and maintenance practices of 
          <PRTPAGE P='299' />
          each borrower for the purpose of assessing loan security and
          determining borrower compliance with RUS policy as outlined in this
          part. This review will normally be done at least once every three
          years. The borrower will make available to RUS the borrower&apos;s
          policies, procedures, and records related to the operations and
          maintenance of its complete system. Reports made by other inspectors
          (e.g., other Federal agencies, State inspectors, etc.) will also be
          made available, as applicable. RUS will not duplicate these other
          reviews but will use their reports to supplement its own review. RUS
          may inspect facilities, as well as records, and may also observe
          construction and maintenance work in the field. Key borrower personnel
          responsible for the facilities being inspected are to accompany RUS
          during such inspections, unless otherwise determined by RUS. RUS
          personnel may prepare an independent summary of the operations and
          maintenance practices of the borrower. The borrower&apos;s management
          will discuss this review and evaluation with its Board of Directors.

            borrowers) through the borrower&apos;s unique knowledge of its
            system, prudent utility practices (which includes development of an

            addendum to meet the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of
