             Sites will meet the requirements of the planned use; for example,
            individual housing or multiple housing or any combination thereof.
            Building sites must be well located and designed to provide a
            desirable living environment. Generally a loan will not be made for
            the development of less than 10 units, but they need not be
            contiguous.

             When an applicant files an application for a loan, the county
            supervisor will advise the applicant that development work must not
            be started and obligations for work, materials, or land purchase
            must not be incurred before the loan is closed. If, nevertheless,
            the applicant incurs obligations for work, materials, or land
            purchase before the loan is closed, the State director may authorize
            the use of loan funds to pay such obligations only when he finds
            that all the following conditions exist:

             When the real estate mortgage is returned by the recording
            official, the county supervisor will retain the original in the
            borrower&apos;s case folder. If the original is retained by the
            recording official for the county records, a conformed copy
            including the recording data showing the date and place of
            recordation and book and page number will be prepared and filed in
            the borrower&apos;s case folder. A copy of the mortgage will be
            delivered to the borrower but will be conformed only if required by
            State law or if it is the custom of other lenders in the area.
