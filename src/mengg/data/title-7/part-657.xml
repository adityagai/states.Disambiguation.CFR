          NRCS is concerned about any action that tends to impair the productive
          capacity of American agriculture. The Nation needs to know the extent
          and location of the best land for producing food, feed, fiber forage,
          and oilseed crops. In addition to prime and unique farmlands,
          farmlands that are of statewide and local importance for producing
          these crops also need to be identified.

          It is NRCS policy to make and keep current an inventory of the prime
          farmland and unique farmland of the Nation. This inventory is to be
          carried out in cooperation with other interested agencies at the
          National, State, and local levels of government. The objective of the
          inventory is to identify the extent and location of important rural
          lands needed to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops.

             Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical
            and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage,
            fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also available for these uses (the
            land could be cropland, pastureland, rangeland, forest land, or
            other land, but not urban built-up land or water). It has the soil
            quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically
            produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed,
            including water management, according to acceptable farming methods.
            In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and dependable water
            supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and
            growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt
            and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are permeable to water
            and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated
            with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood
            frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils that
            qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent
            slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay
            loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes.

            include those that are nearly prime farmland and that economically

            national or statewide importance. Where appropriate, these lands are
            to be identified by the local agency or agencies concerned. In
            places, additional farmlands of local importance may include tracts
            of land that have been designated for agriculture by local
