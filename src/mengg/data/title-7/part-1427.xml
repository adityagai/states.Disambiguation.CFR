             The regulations of this subpart are applicable to the 2008 through
            2012 crops of upland cotton and extra long staple cotton. Rules
            codified in this part which are issued after October 1, 2008, will
            not affect the 2007 and prior crops except that changes in the
            calculation of loan repayment rates that apply to the 2008 crop also
            apply to 2007 crop loans outstanding at the time of the changes in
            2008 crop calculations. Other adjustments for the 2008 crop, such as
            storage rate adjustments will not apply. These regulations set forth
            the general provisions under which marketing assistance loans and
            loan deficiency payment programs shall be administered by the
            Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Additional terms and conditions
            are in the note and security agreement and the loan deficiency
            payment application that must be executed by a producer to receive
            marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments.

             To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans and loan
            deficiency payments, a producer must have beneficial interest in the
            cotton that is tendered to CCC for a marketing assistance loan or
            loan deficiency payment. For the purposes of this part, the term
            “beneficial interest” refers to a determination by CCC that a person
            has the requisite title to and control of cotton that is tendered to
            CCC as collateral for a marketing assistance loan or is the cotton
            that will be used to determine a loan deficiency payment. A
            determination of whether a person has beneficial interest in cotton
            is made by CCC in accordance with this part and is not based upon a
            determination under any State law or any other regulation of a
            Federal agency.

            if not baled, the date consumed, without further processing, in a
            continuous manufacturing process.

             This subpart is applicable to the 2008 through 2012 crops of upland
            and extra long staple seed cotton. These regulations set forth the
            terms and conditions under which recourse seed cotton loans shall be
            made available by CCC. Such loans will be available through March 31
            of the year following the calendar year in which such crop is
            normally harvested. CCC may change the loan availability period to
            conform to State or locally imposed quarantines. Additional terms
            and conditions are in the note and security agreement which must be
            executed by a producer in order to receive such loans.

          Approved storage shall consist of storage located on or off the
          producer&apos;s farm (excluding public warehouses) which is determined
          by a county committee representative to afford adequate protection
          against loss or damage and which is located within a reasonable
          distance, as determined by CCC, from an approved gin. If the cotton is
          not stored on the producer&apos;s farm, the producer must furnish
          satisfactory evidence that the producer has the authority to store the
          cotton on such property and that the owner of such property has no
          lien for such storage against the cotton. The producer must provide
          satisfactory evidence that the producer and any person having an
          interest in the cotton including CCC, have the right to enter the
          premises to inspect and examine the cotton and shall permit a
          reasonable time to such persons to remove the cotton from the
          premises.

            linters, under a Cotton Storage Agreement, which are owned by CCC or
