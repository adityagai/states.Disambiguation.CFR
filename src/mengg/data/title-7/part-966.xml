          The committee may recommend, and pursuant thereto, the Secretary may
          approve, the reapportionment of members among districts, and the
          reestablishment of districts within the production area. In
          recommending any such changes, the committee shall give consideration
          to: (a) Shifts in tomato acreage within districts and within the
          production area during recent years; (b) the importance of new
          production in its relation to existing districts; (c) the equitable
          relationship of committee membership and districts; (d) economies to
          result for producers in promoting efficient administration due to
          redistricting or reapportionment of members within districts; and (e)
          other relevant factors. No change in districting or in apportionment
          of members within districts may become effective within less than 30
          days prior to the date on which terms of office begin each year and no
          recommendations for such redistricting or reapportionment may be made
          less than six months prior to such date.

            committee a season to adjust its reserve funds to meet any
            additional obligations.

          Each handler who handles tomatoes grown in the production area must be
          certified as a registered handler by the committee in order to ship
          such tomatoes outside of the regulated area. A handler who is
          certified as a registered handler is a handler who has adequate
          facilities to meet the requirements for preparing tomatoes for market,
          obtains inspection on tomatoes handled, agrees to handle tomatoes in
          compliance with the order&apos;s grade, size and container
          requirements, pays applicable assessments on a timely basis, submits
          reports required by the committee, and agrees to comply with other
          regulatory requirements on the handling of tomatoes grown in the
          production area.

             Based on the criteria specified in this section, the committee
            shall determine eligibility for certification as a registered
            handler. The committee or its authorized agent shall inspect a
            handler&apos;s facilities to determine if the facilities are
            adequate for preparing tomatoes for market. In order to be adequate
            for such purposes, the facilities must be permanent, nonportable
            buildings located in the production area with equipment that is
            nonportable for the proper washing, grading, sizing and packing of
            tomatoes grown in the production area.

             A registered handler&apos;s certification shall be cancelled by the

            to pay assessments within 45 days of the end of the assessment
            billing period, fails to provide reports, or no longer has adequate
            facilities as described in this section. Cancellation of a
            handler&apos;s registration shall be made in writing to the handler
            and shall specify the reason(s) for and effective date of such
            cancellation. The committee shall recertify the handler&apos;s
            registration at such time as the handler corrects the deficiencies
            which resulted in the cancellation. Certification is permanent until
            the committee determines, based on criteria herein, that
            cancellation is warranted. Persons who make deliveries of ungraded
            tomatoes to such certified registered handlers are hereby determined
            to be exempt from otherwise applicable regulations pursuant to this

             The prevailing principle which shall apply to the determination of
            “producer” is who or which interest as a unit, whether an
            individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other
            business unit, has the authority to pass title to the tomatoes grown
            and made a part of the marketable supply of tomatoes. In other
            words, the terms shall be limited to those who have an ownership in
            tomatoes produced in the production area.

             A producer eligible to vote is a person who produced tomatoes for
            market in a proprietary capacity in the production area during the
            then current fiscal period, i.e., between August 1, of the previous
            year and July 31 of the then current year. If a person who would
            otherwise qualify as a producer in a proprietary capacity in the
            production area planted tomatoes for market as fresh tomatoes during
            the current fiscal period, but (1) did not market any tomatoes in
            the fresh market during the current fiscal period due to adverse
            weather conditions, or (2) has tomatoes in production for fresh
            market during the current fiscal period, although still unharvested,
            he shall, nevertheless, be eligible as a producer to vote for
            committee nominees, if he produced and marketed tomatoes grown in
            the production area in the next preceding fiscal period.
