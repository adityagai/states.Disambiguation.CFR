            Rangeland
          </E>
           means a land cover/use category on which the climax or potential
          plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike
          plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing, and
          introduced forage species that are managed like rangeland. This term
          would include areas where introduced hardy and persistent grasses are
          planted and such practices as deferred grazing, burning, chaining, and
          rotational grazing are used, with little or no chemicals or fertilizer
          being applied. Grasslands, savannas, prairie, many wetlands, some
          deserts, tundra, coastal marshes and wet meadows are considered to be
          rangeland. Certain communities of low forbs and shrubs, such as
          mesquite, chaparral, mountain shrub, and pinyon-juniper, are also
          included as rangeland.

             NRCS will determine whether the application meets the eligibility
            criteria, and will place applications into an enrollment category

            notice and into a Tier based on the criteria in 1469.5(e).
            Enrollment categories will be funded in the order designated in the
            sign-up notice until the available funding is exhausted. NRCS will
            determine the number of categories that can be funded in accordance

            determinations.

             NRCS will develop a conservation stewardship contract for the
            selected applications. If the contract falls within the enrollment
            categories and subcategories funded in the given sign-up, NRCS will
            make payments as described in the contract in return for the
            implementation and/or maintenance of a specified level of
            conservation treatment on all or part of the agricultural operation.

             Upon agreement by NRCS and the participant, a conservation
            stewardship contract may include provisions that lead to a higher
            tier of participation during the contract period. Such a transition
            does not require a contract modification if that transition is laid
            out in the schedule of contract activities. In the event that such a
            transition begins with Tier I, only the land area in the
            agricultural operation that meets the requirements for enrollment in
            Tier I can be enrolled in the contract until the transition occurs.
            Upon transition from Tier I to a higher tier of participation, the
            entire agricultural operation must be incorporated into the
            contract. All requirements applicable to the higher tier of
            participation would then apply. NRCS will calculate all stewardship,
            existing practice, new practice payments, and enhancement payments
            using the applicable enrolled acreage at the time of the payment.

            area to be enrolled in the CSP into land use categories, such as

        <P>
          Any authorized NRCS representative has the right to enter an
          agricultural operation for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of
          any representations made in a contract or in anticipation of entering
          a contract, as to the performance of the terms and conditions of the
          contract. Access includes the right to provide technical assistance,
          inspect any work undertaken under the contract, and collect
          information necessary to evaluate the performance of conservation
          practices in the contract. The NRCS representative will make a
          reasonable effort to contact the participant prior to the exercise of
          this provision.

        <P>
          If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized
          representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that
          the action or advice was improper or erroneous, the State
          Conservationist may accept the advice or action as meeting the
          requirements of CSP. In addition, the State Conservationist may grant
          relief, to the extent it is deemed desirable by CCC, to provide a fair
          and equitable treatment because of the good faith reliance on the part
          of the participant.

             If the producer acquires land subsequent to enrollment in CSP, that
            land is not considered part of the agricultural operation; however,
            if the land was previously owned or controlled by them before the
            date of enrollment and after May 13, 2002, then NRCS will conduct an
            investigation into the activity to see if there was a scheme or
            device.
