             Each handler shall pay to the committee upon demand his pro rata
            share of the expenses authorized by the Secretary for each fiscal
            period. Each handler&apos;s pro rata share shall be the rate of
            assessment per hundredweight fixed by the Secretary times the
            quantity of potatoes which he handles as the first handler thereof.
            At any time during or after a fiscal period, the Secretary may
            increase the rate of assessment as necessary to cover authorized
            expenses. The payment of expenses for the maintenance and
            functioning of the committee may be required during periods when no
            regulations are in effect. If a handler does not pay his assessment
            within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be
            increased by a late payment charge or an interest charge, at rates
            prescribed by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.

          the event the handler fails to pay the delinquent assessment amount,
          plus the late payment charge, within 60 days following the billing
          date, an additional one percent interest charge shall be applied
          monthly thereafter to the unpaid balance, including any accumulated
          interest. Any amount paid by a handler as an assessment, including any
          charges imposed pursuant to this paragraph, shall be credited when the
          payment is received in the committee office.
