             Effective January 1, 1995, the prior regime of absolute quotas for
            certain dairy products was replaced by a system of tariff-rate
            quotas. The articles subject to licensing under the new tariff-rate
            quotas are listed in Appendices 1, 2, and 3 of this subpart.
            Licenses will be issued pursuant to the provisions of this subpart
            for the 1997 and subsequent quota years. These licenses will permit
            the holder to import specified quantities of the subject articles
            into the United States at the applicable in-quota rate of duty. If
            an importer has no license for an article subject to a tariff-rate
            quota, such importer will, with certain exceptions, be required to
            pay the applicable over-quota rate of duty.

            fair and equitable allocation of the right to import articles
            subject to such tariff-rate quotas. The subpart will also maximize

            account of any special factors which may have affected or maybe
            affecting the trade in the articles concerned.

            a country by a series of random draws. A license of minimum size
            will be issued to each applicant in the order established by such
            draws until the total amount of such article in Appendix 2 has been
            allocated. An applicant that receives a license for an article will
            be removed from the pool for subsequent draws until every applicant
            has been allocated at least one license, provided that the licenses
            for which they applied are not already fully allocated. Any amount
            remaining after the random draws which is less than the applicable
            minimum license size may, at the discretion of the Licensing
            Authority, be prorated equally among the licenses awarded for that

             If a licensee sells or conveys its business involving articles
            covered by this subpart to another person, including the complete
            transfer of the attendant assets, the Licensing Authority will
            transfer to such other person the historical, nonhistorical or
            designated license issued for that quota year. Such sale or
            conveyance must be unconditional, except that it may be in escrow
            with the sole condition for return of escrow being that the
            Licensing Authority determines that such sale does not meet the
            requirements of this paragraph.

            the documents for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)
            of this section and advise the parties in writing of its findings by
            the end of the 20-day period. The parties shall have the burden of
            demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Licensing Authority that
            the contemplated sale or conveyance complies with the requirements
            of paragraph (a) of this section. Within 15 days of the consummation
            of the sale or conveyance, the parties shall mail copies of the

          a country are likely to fall short of that country&apos;s allocated
          amount as indicated in Appendices 1, 2, and 3, the Licensing Authority
          may permit, with the approval of the Office of the United States Trade
          Representative, the applicable licensees to enter the remaining
          balance or a portion thereof from any country during that quota year.
          Requests for consideration of such adjustments must be submitted to
          the Licensing Authority no later than September 1. The Licensing
          Authority will obtain prior consent for such an adjustment of licenses
          from the government of the exporting country for quantities in
          accordance with the Uruguay Round commitment of the United States.

             “Similar article produced in the United States” shall be an article
            of cheese, cheese product, or imitation cheese produced in the
            United States and marketed in the domestic wholesale market, which
            is determined by the Investigating Authority, based upon available
            information to be most like the imported article of quota cheese
            alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, in terms of its
            physical properties and end use. In making this determination, first
            consideration shall be given to the normal end uses of the article
            produced in the United States in comparison with the end use of the
            article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in
            price-undercutting. If the end use of both articles is determined to
            be the same (e.g., processing or retail sale), the physical
            characteristics of the two articles shall be considered.
          </text>
        </P>
        <FP>
          If the common end use of the two articles is processing, the
          representative samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms
          of processing quality, taking special note of processing yields. If
          the common end use of the two articles is retail sale, representative
          samples of the two articles shall be examined in terms of similarities
          of taste, texture, general appearance, quality, age, and packaging.
          Imported imitation quota cheese shall only be compared with imitation
          domestic cheese. If it is determined that the domestic cheese the
          price of which is claimed to be undercut is not similar to the quota
          cheese allegedly undercutting it, there shall be no finding of
          price-undercutting.
