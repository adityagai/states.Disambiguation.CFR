           Complaint Request. If the Director finds that your complaint is an
          eligible complaint, the Director will: review all documents and
          evidence submitted by you; review all agency or CR files, if any
          exist, regarding the circumstances surrounding the alleged
          discrimination; review any damage claims; and seek any further
          clarification, if necessary, from either you or the agency. CR also
          may refer your eligible complaint for a formal investigation by the CR
          Program Investigation Division or by an outside contractor. Based on
          his or her review, the Director will either undertake negotiations
          with you to resolve the complaint; or inform you that CR will not
          settle the complaint and explain to you your options, including your
          right to request formal proceedings before an ALJ under subpart D of
          this part within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Director that
          CR will not settle the complaint. If the complaint is successfully
          resolved or settled, the Director will issue a final determination

          The first step in this process involves a response to your hearing
          request by OCR. OCR will turn over its entire file on your complaint
          to the ALJ. OCR also will file a report with the ALJ stating its
          position with respect to whether or not your complaint is an eligible
          complaint, with reasons for its position, as well as stating its
          position with respect to the merits of your complaint. OCR must turn
          over its file and make its report on its position on your complaint
          within 35 days. OCR must provide a copy to you of anything it provides
          to the ALJ.

             At any time after the parties have been notified of your hearing
            request, you may file a request with the ALJ to make a determination
            based on the written record. With your request, you should file any
            other arguments or evidence that you wish the ALJ to consider. The
            agency and OCR will have 35 days after you file your request to file
            any additional information, arguments, or evidence for the
            consideration of the ALJ. The ALJ may recommend dismissal of your
            complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not an eligible
            complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint on the
            merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your
            eligible complaint and recommend to award you such relief as would
            be afforded under the applicable statute or regulation under which
            the eligible complaint was filed. The ALJ will make a proposed
            determination on your complaint based on the original complaint, the
            
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

             Complaint Request, the OCR report, and any other evidence or
            written documents filed by the parties. The proposed determination
            will become the final determination 35 days after it is filed unless
            you request review of the proposed determination by the ASCR. The
            ASCR also may review the proposed determination on his or her own
            initiative. If the ASCR reviews the decision, he or she will allow
            the parties a reasonable opportunity to file briefs in support of or
            opposition to the proposed determination, and afterwards will issue
            a final determination within 35 days after you request review of the
            proposed determination.

             The ALJ may hold a pre-hearing conference. If such a conference is
            to be held, the notice of the pre-hearing conference also will
            contain a notice to the parties of a time and date for the
            pre-hearing conference. Pre-hearing conferences normally will be
            held by telephone. Issues that may be addressed at the pre-hearing
            conference may include: simplification of the issues; the
            possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the
            authenticity of documents; limitation of the number of witnesses;
            exchange of copies of hearing exhibits; negotiation, compromise or
            settlement of issues; identification of documents of which official
            notice will be requested; a schedule for completion of the actions
            decided upon at the conference; and any other matters that may aid
            and expedite the conclusion of the proceeding. No transcript of the
            pre-hearing conference will be made but the ALJ will issue a written
            memorandum summarizing the results of the pre-hearing conference.

            position with respect to the complaint, the facts upon which the
            party intends to rely, the legal theories upon which the party
            intends to rely, copies of or a list of the documents and exhibits
            which the party anticipates on introducing at the hearing, and a
            list of anticipated witnesses.

             A party may request an order from the ALJ to take the testimony of
            any person by deposition upon oral examination or written
            interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at
            the place of examination, for use as evidence. The application for
            the order must specify the reason and need for taking testimony by
            deposition.

             The time, place, and manner of taking depositions will be as

             No testimony taken by depositions will be considered as part of the
            evidence in the hearing until such testimony is offered and received
            in evidence at the hearing, and ordinarily it will not be received
            into evidence if the deponent is present and can testify at the
            hearing. However, when the deponent is present and can testify, the
            deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the
            deponent given at the hearing. Where you have requested a final
            determination by the ALJ based on the written record without a
            hearing, the ALJ, in his or her discretion, may receive depositions
            to supplement the record.

            matters at issue. The ALJ may confine the presentation of facts and
            evidence to pertinent matters and exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or
            unduly repetitious evidence, information, or questions. Each party
            will have the opportunity to present oral and documentary evidence,
            oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments in support of the
            party&apos;s position; controvert evidence relied on by any other
            party; and question all witnesses. The testimony of witnesses at a
            hearing will be on oath or affirmation and will be subject to
            cross-examination. Any evidence may be received by the ALJ without
            regard to whether that evidence could be admitted in judicial
            proceedings. Upon a finding of good cause, the ALJ may order that
            any witness be examined separately and apart from all other
            witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.

            dismissal of your complaint on the basis of a finding that it is not
            an eligible complaint; recommend denial of your eligible complaint
            on the merits; or make a proposed finding of discrimination on your

            review the proposed determination on his or her own initiative. If

          When I or someone else has to do something within a certain number of
          days, how will USDA or the ALJ count the days?
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          Unless otherwise specifically noted, a “day” refers to a calendar day
          and a document that must be filed by a certain date must either be
          postmarked on that date or received by the Docketing Clerk on that
          date. For documents that must be or are “filed” under these
          regulations, you count the number of days after filing starting with
          the day after the filing date as day one. For other time periods, you
          calculate the time period by counting the day after receipt by the
          party as day one. If the last day of a time period expires on a
          Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day of the time
          period will expire on the next business day.

        <P>
          You may request that the ALJ extend a deadline in these rules, or
          afford you relief for missing a deadline, which he or she may do,
          consistent with the principles of sovereign immunity, the terms of any
          applicable statute, these rules, and the necessity of expeditious
          completion of the public business. It is the intent of USDA that the
          time deadlines expressed in these regulations be construed equitably
          to ensure resolution of eligible complaints, to the extent permitted
          by law.
