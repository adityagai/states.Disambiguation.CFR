            compare the borrower&apos;s average total revenue and average
            residential revenue with statewide data in the table of Average
            Revenue per Kilowatthour for Electric Utilities by Sector, Census

            Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (DOE),

            recent calendar year for which full year DOE data are available at
            the time of loan approval and borrower data for the same year.

             For loans approved on or after February 21, 1995, the fund advance
            period begins on the date of the loan note and is one year longer
            than the loan period, but not less than 4 years. For example, the
            fund advance period for a loan with a 2-year loan period terminates
            automatically 4 years after the date of the loan note; a loan with a
            4-year loan period terminates automatically 5 years after the date
            of the loan note. The Administrator may extend the fund advance
            period on any loan if the borrower meets the requirements of
            paragraph (c) of this section. As defined in
