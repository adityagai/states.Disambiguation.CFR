             If FNS determines that there has been negligence or fraud on the
            part of the State agency in the certification of applicant
            households, the State agency shall, upon demand, pay to FNS a sum
            equal to the amount of coupons issued as a result of such negligence
            or fraud.

             A State agency aggrieved by claims asserted against it may file
            written appeals with the Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
            c/o the Executive Secretary, State Food Stamp Appeals Board, Food
            and Nutrition Service, USDA, Washington, DC 20250, requesting an
            opportunity to present information in support of its position. The
            State agency shall attach a copy of the FNS claim to its appeal.
            Appeals must be filed with the Executive Secretary or postmarked
            within 10 days of the date of delivery of the notice of claim. If
            the State agency does not appeal within the prescribed 10-day
            period, the FNS decision on the claim shall be final. No extension
            shall be granted in the time allowed for filing an appeal.

             With one exception, the filing of a timely appeal and request for

            acceptable appeal, until a final determination has been issued. The
            exceptions to this provision are those claims 
            <PRTPAGE P='966' />
            that are asserted against State agencies due to State agency failure

            . In situations where a State agency does not reduce, suspend or
            cancel benefits as directed and FNS takes action to disallow
            administrative funds or bill the State agency, the disallowance
            and/or billing shall remain in effect during the review process.
            Should the Appeals Board uphold the State agency, all disallowed
            funds and/or funds collected as a result of the billing shall be
            restored to the State agency promptly.

             No extension of time shall be permitted a State agency in which to
            file an initial request for an administrative review. All other
            requests from the State agency or from FNS for the extension of any
            deadline contained in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>

            </aref>
             these regulations or imposed by the Appeals Board or hearing
            official shall be granted only for good cause shown and only when
            received by the Executive Secretary before the expiration of the
            particular deadline involved. All requests for an extension shall be
            in writing. Filing a request for an extension stops the running of
            the prescribed period of time. When a request for an extension is
            granted, the requester shall be notified in writing of the amount of
            additional time granted. When a request is denied for being untimely
            or for cause, the requester shall be notified and the prescribed
            period of time shall resume from the date of denial.

             The Appeals Board or hearing official may grant itself such
            additional time as it may reasonably require to complete any of its
            assigned responsibilities. If the Appeals Board or hearing official
            does find it necessary to grant itself an extension of time, the

            Executive Secretary shall notify all parties in writing.
