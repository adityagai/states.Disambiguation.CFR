          The Rural Business Investment Company (“RBIC”) Program is a
          Developmental Venture Capital program for the purpose of promoting
          economic development and the creation of wealth and job opportunities
          in Rural Areas and among individuals living in such Areas. To this
          end, the Secretary will select and license RBIC Applicants that will
          agree to address the unmet Equity Capital needs of Smaller Enterprises
          primarily located in Rural Areas.

             Units of local government may petition the Under Secretary of Rural

            petition to both the appropriate Rural Development State Director
            and the Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator of USDA on
            behalf of the Under Secretary. The petition shall document how the
            area meets the requirements of paragraph (6)(i)(A) or (B) of this
            definition and discuss why the petitioner believes the area is
            “rural in character,” including, but not limited to, the area&apos;s
            population density, demographics, and topography and how the local
            economy is tied to a rural economic base. Upon receiving a petition,
            the Under Secretary will consult with the applicable Governor or
            leader in a similar position and request comments to be submitted
            within 5 business days, unless such comments were submitted 
            <PRTPAGE P='1059' />
            with the petition. The Under Secretary will release to the public a
            notice of a petition filed by a unit of local government not later
            than 30 days after receipt of the petition by way of publication in
            a local newspaper and posting on the Agency&apos;s Web site, and the
            Under Secretary will make a determination not less than 15 days, but
            no more than 60 days, after the release of the notice. Upon a
            negative determination, the Under Secretary will provide to the
            petitioner an opportunity to appeal a determination to the Under
            Secretary, and the petitioner will have 10 business days to appeal
            the determination and provide further information for consideration.

             You may employ an Investment Adviser/Manager who will be subject to
            the supervision of your board of directors, managing member(s), or
            general partner(s). If you have Leverage or plan to seek Leverage,
            you must obtain the Secretary&apos;s prior written approval of the
            management contract. Approval of an Investment Adviser/Manager for
            one RBIC does not indicate approval of that manager for any other
            RBIC.

            any debt that is secured by any of your assets and not guaranteed by
            the Secretary, including secured guarantees and other contingent
            obligations that you voluntarily assume and secured lines of credit.

             You must get the Secretary&apos;s written approval before you incur

            third-party debt, including any renewal of a secured line of credit,
            increase in the maximum amount available under a secured line of
            credit, or expansion of the scope of a security interest or lien.
            For purposes of this paragraph (b), “expansion of the scope of a
            security interest or lien” does not include the substitution of one
            asset or group of assets for another, provided the asset values (as

            security interest in your investor commitments in excess of 125

            passive Enterprise if it passes substantially all of the proceeds
            through to one or more subsidiary companies, each of which is an
            eligible Enterprise that is not passive. For the purpose of this
            paragraph (b)(2), “subsidiary company” means a company in which at
            least 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities are owned by
            the Financed passive Enterprise.

             You may charge a reasonable prepayment penalty which must be agreed

            a prepayment is unreasonable, you must refund the entire penalty to
            the Portfolio Concern. A prepayment penalty equal to five percent of
            the outstanding balance during the first year of any Financing,
            declining by one percentage point per year through the fifth year,
            is considered the maximum reasonable amount.

             You must calculate the amount due the third-party holder by
            multiplying the total amount you intend to distribute by a fraction
            whose numerator is the outstanding principal of your Debenture(s)
            immediately preceding your distribution, and whose denominator is
            the sum of your Leverageable Capital as of that time plus the
            outstanding principal amount of your Debentures. For purposes of the
            preceding sentence “principal” means both the net proceeds and
            interest accrued to date of a discounted Debenture. The amount of
            any payment received under this section will be credited first
            against unpaid interest accrued to the date of distribution and then
            to the principal in whole or in part of the first Debenture you
            select to prepay and then to the interest and principal in whole or
            in part of such other Debenture(s) as you select to prepay. You may
            elect to prepay in whole any discounted Debenture under this section
            only within five years of its maturity date. Payments under this
            section must be made on the next occurring March 1 or September 1.
