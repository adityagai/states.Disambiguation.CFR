          Pending final action by the Secretary, any person authorized to
          countersign a license to perform grading service may, whenever such
          action is deemed necessary to assure that any grading service is
          properly performed, suspend any license to perform grading service
          issued pursuant to this part, by 
          <PRTPAGE P='47' />
          giving notice of such suspension or revocation to the respective
          licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. Within 7
          days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and statement of
          reasons, the licensee may file an appeal in writing with the
          Secretary, supported by any argument or evidence that the licensee may
          wish to offer as to why their license should not be further suspended
          or revoked. After the expiration of the aforesaid 7-day period and
          consideration of such argument and evidence, the Secretary will take
          such action as deemed appropriate with respect to such suspension or
          revocation. When no appeal is filed within the prescribed 7 days, the
          license to perform grading service is revoked.

          Federal graders may participate in certain political activities,
          including management of and participation in political campaigns, in
          accordance with AMS policy. Graders are subject to these rules while
          they are on leave with or without pay, including furlough; however the
          rules do not apply to cooperative employees not under Federal
          supervision and intermittent employees on the days they perform no
          service. Willful violations of the political activity rules will
          constitute grounds for removal from the AMS.

             This type of service is performed when an applicant requests

            a regular basis. Charges or fees are based on the time, travel, and
            expenses needed to perform the work. This service also may be called
            the fee grading service. Shell eggs graded under fee grading service
            are not eligible to be identified with the official grademarks shown
            in

             Service on a resident basis has a scheduled tour of duty, while
            service on a nonresident basis has a nonscheduled tour of duty. Both
            of these services are performed when an applicant requests that a
            USDA licensed grader be stationed in the applicant&apos;s processing
            plant and grade shell eggs in accordance with U.S. Standards. The
            applicant agrees to comply with the facility, operating, and
            sanitary requirements of resident service. The charges for resident
            grading services are based on the hours of the regular tour of duty
            and the volume of shell eggs received into the plant, while
            nonscheduled service is based on the cumulative time required to
            perform the work and an administrative service charge. Shell eggs
            graded under resident grading service are only eligible to be

        <P>
          Immediately after an appeal grading is completed, an appeal
          certificate shall be issued to show that the original grading was
          sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate shall supersede any
          previously issued certificate for the product involved and shall
          clearly identify the number and date of the superseded certificate.
          The issuance of the appeal certificate may be withheld until any
          previously issued certificate and all copies have been returned when
          such action is deemed necessary to protect the interest of the
          Government. When the appeal grader assigns a different grade to the
          lot, the existing grademark shall be changed or obliterated as
          necessary. When the appeal grader assigns a different class or
          quantity designation to the lot, the labeling shall be corrected.

            be packed only in new or good used packing material and new
            packaging materials that are clean, free of mold, mustiness and off
            odors, and must be of sufficient strength and durability to
            adequately protect the eggs during normal distribution. When packed
            in other than fiber packing material, the containers must be of
            sound construction and maintained in a reasonably clean manner.
