          Under the Food Stamp Act, each State agency is responsible for the
          administration of the Food Stamp Program in accordance with the Act,
          Regulations, and the State agency&apos;s plan of operation. To fulfill
          the requirements of the Act, each State agency shall have a system for
          monitoring and improving its administration of the program. The State
          agency is also responsible for reporting on its administration to FNS.
          These reports shall identify program deficiencies and the specific
          administrative action proposed to meet the program requirements
          established by the Secretary. If it is determined, however, that a
          State has failed without good cause to meet any of the program
          requirements established by the Secretary, or has failed to carry out
          the approved State plan of operation, the Department shall suspend
          and/or disallow from the State such funds as are determined to be
          appropriate in accordance with

          The Food and Nutrition Service shall conduct the review described in
          this section to determine whether a State agency is operating the Food
          Stamp Program and the Performance Reporting System in accordance with
          program requirements. The Federal reviewer may consolidate the
          scheduling and conduction of these reviews to reduce the frequency of
          entry into the State agency. FNS regional offices will conduct
          additional reviews to examine State agency and project area
          operations, as considered necessary to determine compliance with
          program requirements. FNS shall notify the State agency of any
          deficiencies detected in program or system operations. Any
          deficiencies detected in program or system operations which do not
          necessitate long range analytical and evaluative measures for
          corrective action development shall be immediately corrected by the
          State agency. Within 60 days of receipt of the findings of each review
          established below, State agencies shall develop corrective action
          addressing all other deficiencies detected in either program or system
          operations and shall ensure that the State agency&apos;s own
          corrective action plan is amended and that FNS is provided this
          information at the time of the next formal semiannual update to the

             FNS will review each State agency&apos;s management evaluation
            system on a biennial basis; however, FNS may review a State
            agency&apos;s management evaluation system on a more frequent basis
            if a regular review reveals serious deficiencies in the ME system.
            The ME review will include but not be limited to a determination of
            whether or not the State agency is complying with FNS regulations,
            an assessment of the State agency&apos;s methods and procedures for
            conducting ME reviews, and an assessment of the data collected by
            the State agency in conducting the reviews.

            causes and magnitude and are properly included in either the State
            or Project Area/Management Unit corrective action plan; the State

            FNS will examine the State agency&apos;s corrective action
            monitoring and evaluative efforts. The assessment of corrective
            action will be conducted at the State agency, project area, and
            local level offices, as necessary.

            within the timeframes specified in the State agency and/or Project
            Area/Management Unit corrective action plans and to determine the
            effectiveness of the corrective action. The on-site reviews will
            provide State agencies and FNS with a mechanism for early detection
            of problems in the corrective action process to minimize losses to
            the program, participants, or potential participants.

             A request for an alternate review schedule shall be submitted for

            once every three years. Approval of an alternate schedule is
            dependent upon a State agency&apos;s justification that the project
            areas that will be reviewed less frequently than required in
            paragraph (b)(1) of this section are performing adequately and that
            previous reviews indicate few problems or that known problems have

            Until FNS approval of an alternate schedule is obtained, the State
            agency shall conduct reviews in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of

             State agencies shall also establish a system for monitoring those

            of migratory workers during such migrations. This requirement may be
            satisfied by either scheduling ME reviews to coincide with such
            migrations or by conducting special reviews. As part of the review
            the State agency shall contact local migrant councils, advocate
            groups, or other organizations in the project area to ensure that
            migrants are receiving the required services.

             For the purpose of ME reviews, State agencies may, subject to FNS
            approval, establish “management units” which are different from
            project areas designated by FNS for participation in the program.
            For example, State-established welfare districts, regions or other
            administrative structures within a State may be so designated.
            Management units can be designated as either large, medium, or small
            for purposes of frequency of review. However, establishment of
            management units solely for the purpose of reducing the frequency of
            review will not be approved by FNS.

             When a sub-unit has more than one of the areas of functional
            responsibility specified in paragraph (a) of this section, it shall
            be included in each applicable classification and if selected for
            review, all functions performed shall be examined. For example, if a
            sub-unit has an organizational entity which certifies households and
            also has an entity which regularly issues coupons, the sub-unit
            shall be designated as both a certification and an issuance office.
            Thus, in an HIR issuance system, sub-units designated as issuance
            offices would usually also be designated as DMU&apos;s since the HIR
            masterfile is usually maintained at the issuance site in this
            system.

             Certain sub-units shall not be designated as having combined
            responsibilities, even though they may perform certain functions
            related to more than one of the areas. For example, coupon issuers
            must maintain a level of coupon inventory to ensure that
            participants&apos; needs are met on a daily basis but do not supply
            other issuance sites with bulk supplies of coupons. Such a sub-unit
            would not be classified as a bulk storage point. Certification
            offices may issue coupons in emergency situations or to meet the
            requirements of expedited service but do not routinely issue coupons
            to households under standard certifications. In these and similar
            situations, the sub-unit would be classified based upon its primary
            function exclusively. However, when any sub-unit is selected, all
            program requirements specified in

             Units which certify households and/or issue coupons as satellites
            of a central sub-unit shall not be classified as independent
            sub-units. Units may be identified as itinerant when they do not
            operate on a regular basis, retain certification records, store
            coupons, transmit information directly to the DMU and/or develop
            FNS-250 reports independently. Examples of such units include mobile
            units, short term or seasonal operations, and units which may
            operate on a regular basis but do not meet the criteria for a
            sub-unit described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, when a
            sub-unit is selected for review which acts as a parent unit for
            itinerant service points, at least one itinerant point per sub-unit
            shall be reviewed if operational at the time of the review.

            State agencies of the minimum program areas to be reviewed at least
            90 days before the beginning of each annual review period, which is
            the Federal fiscal year. FNS may add additional areas during the
            review period if deemed necessary. The FNS headquarters office will
            add national target areas during the review period only for
            deficiencies of national scope. State agencies have 60 days in which
            to establish a plan schedule for such reviews.

             State agencies shall be responsible for reviewing each national

            agency&apos;s request for a waiver from a program requirement, any
            different policy approved by FNS would also be reviewed. When, in
            the course of a review, a project area is found to be out of
            compliance with a given program requirement, the State agency shall
            identify the specifics of the problem including: the extent of the

            specific procedural requirements the project area is misapplying.

             As part of the Performance Reporting System, each State agency is
            responsible for conducting quality control reviews. For food stamp
            quality control reviews, a sample of households shall be selected
            from two different categories: Households which are participating in
            the Food Stamp Program (called active cases) and households for
            which participation was denied, suspended or terminated (called
            negative cases). Reviews shall be conducted on active cases to
            determine if households are eligible and receiving the correct
            allotment of food stamps. The determination of whether the household
            received the correct allotment will be made by comparing the
            eligibility data gathered during the review against the amount
            authorized on the master issuance file. Reviews of negative cases
            shall be conducted to determine whether the State agency&apos;s
            decision to deny, suspend or terminate the household, as of the
            review date, was correct. Quality control reviews measure the
            validity of food stamp cases at a given time (the review date) by
            reviewing against the Food Stamp Program standards established in
            the Food Stamp Act and the Regulations, taking into account any FNS
            authorized waivers to deviate from specific regulatory provisions.
            FNS and the State agency shall analyze findings of the reviews to
            determine the incidence and dollar amounts of errors, which will
            determine the State agency&apos;s liability for payment errors in
            accordance with the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, and to plan
            corrective action to reduce excessive levels of errors for any State
            agency.

             FNS generally recommends a systematic sample design for both active
            and negative samples because of its relative ease to administer, its
            validity, and because it yields a sample proportional to variations
            in the caseload over the course of the annual review period. (To
            obtain a systematic sample, a State agency would select every kth
            case after a random start between 1 and k. The value of k is
            dependent upon the estimated size of the universe and the sample
            size.) A State agency may, however, develop an alternative sampling
            design better suited for its particular situation. Whatever the
            design, it must conform to commonly acceptable statistical theory
            and application (see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).

             A sample of households which were certified prior to, or during,
            the sample month and issued food stamp benefits for the sample month
            shall be selected for quality control review. These active cases
            shall be reviewed to determine if the household is eligible and, if
            eligible, whether the household is receiving the correct allotment.
            The determination of a household&apos;s eligibility shall be based
            on an examination and verification of all elements of eligibility
            (i.e., basic program requirements, resources, income, and
            deductions). The elements of eligibility are specified in

            resulting benefit level determined by the quality control review
            shall be compared to the benefits authorized by the State agency as
            of the review date. When changes in household circumstances occur,
            the reviewer shall determine whether the changes were reported by
            the participant and handled by the agency in accordance with the
            rules set forth in

            fiscal month or the day of certification, whichever is later. The
            review of active cases shall include: a household case record
            review; a field investigation, except as provided in paragraph (b)
            of this section; the identification of any variances; an error
            analysis; and the reporting of review findings.

            case record, the reviewer shall identify as many of the pertinent
            facts as possible from the household issuance record. The case

             If a household refuses to cooperate with the quality control
            reviewer and the State agency has taken other administrative steps
            to obtain that cooperation without obtaining it, the household shall
            be notified of the penalities for refusing to cooperate with respect
            to termination and reapplication, and of the possibility that its
            case will be referred for investigation for willful
            misrepresentation. If a household refuses to cooperate after such
            notice, the reviewer must- attempt to complete the case and shall
            report the household&apos;s refusal to the State agency for
            termination of its participation without regard for the outcome of
            that attempt. For a determination of refusal to be made, the
            household must be able to cooperate, but clearly demonstrate that it
            will not take actions that it can take and that are required to
            complete the quality control review process. In certain
            circumstances, the household may demonstrate that it is unwilling to
            cooperate by not taking actions after having been given every
            reasonable opportunity to do so, even though the household or its
            members do not state that the household refuses to cooperate.
            Instances where the household&apos;s unwillingness to cooperate in
            completing a quality control review has the effect of a refusal to
            cooperate shall include the following:

             A sample of actions to deny applications, or suspend or terminate a
            household in the sample month shall be selected for quality control
            review. These negative actions shall be reviewed to determine
            whether the State agency&apos;s decision to deny, suspend, or
            terminate the household, as of the review date, was correct.
            Depending on the characteristics of individual State systems, the
            review date for negative cases could be the date of the
            agency&apos;s decision to deny, suspend, or terminate program
            benefits, the date on which the decision is entered into the
            computer system, or the date of the notice to the client. State
            agencies must consistently apply the same definition for review date
            to all sample 
            <PRTPAGE P='941' />
            cases of the same classification. The review of negative cases shall
            include a household case record review; an error analysis; and the
            reporting of review findings, including procedural problems with the
            action regardless of the validity of the decision to deny, suspend
            or terminate. In certain instances, contact with the household or a
            collateral contact may be permitted.

             A negative case shall be considered valid if the reviewer is able
            to verify through documentation in the household case record that a
            household was correctly denied, suspended, or terminated from the

            State agency in the notice. Whenever the reviewer is unable to

            suspend, or terminate a household&apos;s participation through such
            documentation, the QC reviewer may contact the household or a
            collateral contact to verify the correctness of the specific
            negative action under review. If the reviewer is unable to verify
            the correctness of the State agency&apos;s decision to deny,
            suspend, or terminate the case for the specific reason given for the
            action, the negative case shall be considered invalid.

             FNS may use quality control information to determine which project
            areas/counties/local offices have reported payment error rates that
            are either significantly greater than the State agency average or
            greater than the national error standard of the Program. When FNS
            notifies a State agency that a “high error” area exists, the State
            agency shall ensure that corrective action is developed and reported
            in accordance with the provisions of

            previously identified as error-prone and taken appropriate action,
            no further State agency shall be required. If a State agency&apos;s
            corrective action plan fails to address problems in FNS-identified
            “high error” areas, FNS may require a State agency to implement new
            or modified cost-effective procedures for the certification of
            households.

             The State agency shall ensure that appropriate corrective action is
            taken on all deficiencies including each case found to be in error
            by quality control reviews and those deficiencies requiring
            corrective action only at the project area level. Moreover, when a
            substantial number of deficiencies are identified which require
            State agency level and/or project area/management unit corrective
            action, the State agency and/or project area/management unit shall
            establish an order of priority to ensure that the most serious
            deficiencies are addressed immediately and corrected as soon as
            possible. Primary factors to be considered when determining the most
            serious deficiencies are:

          Reports on program performance are intended to provide the State an
          opportunity to determine compliance with program requirements,
          identify and resolve emerging problems, and assess the effectiveness
          of actions that have been taken to correct existing problems.
          States&apos; reports enable FNS to assess the nationwide status of
          eligibility and basis of issuance determinations, to ensure State
          compliance with Federal requirements, to assist States in improving
          and strengthening their programs, and to develop Federal policies.
          Reports must be submitted in duplicate to the appropriate FNS Regional

            system, FNS will correct the State agency&apos;s payment and
            negative case error rates based upon a correction to that aspect of
            the State agency&apos;s QC system which is deficient. If FNS cannot

            assign the State agency a payment error rate or negative case error
            rate based upon the best information available. After consultation

            error rate in excess of the national performance measure. The State
            agency must demonstrate that the event had an adverse and
            uncontrollable impact on program operations during the relevant
            period, and the event caused an uncontrollable increase in the error
            rate. Good cause relief will only be considered for that portion of

             Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part,
            or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As
            appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect
            States&apos; otherwise effective administration of the program based
            upon the degree to which the error rate exceeds the national
            performance measure. For example, a reduction in the waiver amount
            may be made when a State agency&apos;s recent error rate history
            indicates that even absent the events described the State agency
            would have exceeded the national performance measure in the review
            period.

             If a State agency has provided insufficient information to
            determine a waiver amount for the uncontrollable effects of a
            natural disaster or civil disorder using factual analysis, the
            waiver amount shall be evaluated using the following formula and
            methodology which measures both the duration and intensity of the
            event. Duration will be measured by the number of months the event
            had an adverse impact on program operations. Intensity will be a
            proportional measurement of the issuances for the counties affected
            to the State&apos;s total issuance. This ratio will be determined
            using issuance figures for the first full month immediately
            preceding the disaster. This figure will not include issuances made
            to households participating under disaster certification authorized
            by FNS and already excluded from the error rate calculations under 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              § 
              <subref title='7' part='275' sect='12' psec='#g_2_vi' tq='N'>
                275.12(g)(2)(vi)
              </subref>
            </aref>
            . The counties considered affected will include counties where the
            disaster/civil disorder occurred, and any other county that the
            State agency can demonstrate had program operations adversely
            impacted due to the event 
            <PRTPAGE P='952' />
            (such as a county that diverted significant numbers of Supplemental
            Nutrition Assistance Program certification or administrative staff).
            The amount of the waiver of liability will be determined using the
            linear equation W = Ia/Ib × [M/12 or Mp/18] × L, where Ia is the
            issuance for the first full month immediately preceding the unusual
            event for the county affected; Ib is the State&apos;s total issuance
            for the first full month immediately preceding the unusual event;
            M/12 is the number of months in the subject fiscal year that the
            unusual event had an adverse impact on program operations; Mp/18 is
            the number of months in the last half (April through September) of
            the prior fiscal year that the unusual event had an adverse impact
            on program operations; L is the total amount of the liability for
            the fiscal year. Mathematically this formula could result in a
            waiver of more than 100 percent of the liability amount; however, no
            more than 100 percent of a State&apos;s liability amount will be
            waived for any one fiscal year. Under this approach, unless the
            State agency can demonstrate a direct uncontrollable impact on the
            error rate, the effects of disasters or civil disorders that ended
            prior to the second half of the prior fiscal year will not be
            considered.

             A significant growth in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
            caseload in a State prior to or during a fiscal year, such as a 15
            percent growth in caseload. Caseload growth which historically
            increases during certain periods of the year will not be considered
            unusual or beyond the State agency&apos;s control.

             Adjustments for these factors may result in a waiver of all, part,
            or none of the liability amount for the applicable period. As
            appropriate, the waiver amount will be adjusted to reflect
            States&apos; otherwise effective administration of the program based
            upon the degree to which the error rate exceeded the national
            performance measure. For example, a reduction in the waiver amount
            may be made when a State agency&apos;s recent error rate history
            indicates that even absent the events described the State agency
            would have exceeded the national performance measure in the review
            period. Under this approach, unless the State agency can demonstrate
            a direct uncontrollable impact on the error rate, the effects of
            caseload growth that ended prior to the second half of the prior
            fiscal year will not be considered.

             A State agency may choose to begin expending State funds for any
            amount of the liability designated as “new investment” in the
            liability amount determination prior to any appeal. FNS reserves the
            right to approve whether the expenditure meets the requirements for
            new investment. Expenditures made prior to approval by the
            Department will be subject to approval before they are accepted.
            Once a new investment plan is approved, the State agency shall
            submit plan modifications to the Department for approval, prior to
            implementation.

             If appropriate, FNS shall initiate collection action on each claim

            reporting period in which the claim arose unless an administrative
            appeal relating to the claim is pending. Such appeals include
            administrative and judicial appeals pursuant to 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              Section 14 of
            </aref>
             the Food and Nutrition Act. If a State agency, in the subsequent
            year, is again subject to a liability amount based on the national
            performance measure and the error rate issued to the State agency,
            the State agency will be required to remit to FNS any money
            designated as at-risk for the prior fiscal year in accordance with
            either the original liability amount or a revised liability amount
            arising from an appeal, as appropriate, within 30 days of the date
            of the final billing. The requirement that the State agency pay the
            at-risk amount for the prior year will be held in abeyance pending
            the outcome of any pending appeal for the subsequent liability. If
            the subsequent year&apos;s liability is reduced to $0, the at-risk
            money from for the prior fiscal year will not be required to be
            paid. If the subsequent year&apos;s liability is not reduced to $0,
            the State agency will be required to pay the at-risk money within 30
            days of the date of the appeal decision. The amount of a

            within 30 days from the date on which the bill for collection is
            received by the State agency, the State agency shall be liable for
            interest on any unpaid portion of such claim accruing from the date
            on which the bill for collection was received by the State agency.
            If the State agency is notified that it failed to invest funds in
            accordance with an approved new investment plan, the State agency
            has 30 days from the date of receipt of notification of
            non-expenditure of new investment funds to pay the Department the
            amount of funds not so invested. If the State agency does not pay
            the Department the amount of funds not invested within 30 days from
            the date of receipt of the notification of non-expenditure, the
            State agency shall be liable for interest on the non-expended funds
            from the date on which the notification was received by the State
            agency. If the State agency agrees to pay the claim through
            reduction in Federal financial participation for administrative
            costs, this agreement shall be considered to be paying the claim. If
            the State agency appeals such claim (in whole or in part), the

            date of the decision on the administrative appeal, or from a date

             the rate for 365 days) compounded in simple interest for the period
            for which the claim is not paid. Interest billings shall be made
            quarterly with the initial billing accruing from the date the
            interest is first due. Because the discount rate for Treasury bills
            is issued weekly, the interest rate for State agency claims shall be
            averaged for the appropriate weeks.

            in each category. Subsequently, FNS will divide the remaining money
            among the States in each category (see paragraph (b) of this
            section) in proportion to the size of their caseloads (the average
            number of households per month for the fiscal year for which
            performance is measured).

             A State cannot be awarded two bonuses in the same category; the
            relevant categories are payment accuracy (which is outlined in
            paragraph (b)(1) of this section), negative error rate (which is
            outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), or program access
            index (which is outlined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). If a
            State is determined to be among the best and the most improved in a
            category, it will be awarded a bonus only for being the best. The
            next State in the best category will be awarded a bonus as being
            among the best States.

            March Supplement to the Current Population Survey&apos;s (CPS) count
            of people below 125 percent of poverty for the same calendar year.
