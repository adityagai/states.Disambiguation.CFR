             FSA will assess late payment interest on the full amount of
            delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the term “full
            amount of the delinquent debt” means the sum of the principal,
            accrued program interest, and any other charges which are otherwise
            due and owing to FSA on the delinquent debt at the time the late
            payment interest is assessed, except as provided in paragraphs
            (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.

             The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate of
            interest which FSA charges on delinquent debts. The late payment
            interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury
            Department&apos;s current value 
            <PRTPAGE P='389' />
            of funds rate or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt
            Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs
            (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. The rate of interest assessed
            under the Prompt Payment Act was chosen as an alternative rate to
            ensure that the Government would recoup interest at a rate which was
            at least as high as that which it pays for late payments.

            defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new

            collected under the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the
