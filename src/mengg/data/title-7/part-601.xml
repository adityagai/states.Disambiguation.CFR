          The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the Federal
          agency that works with private landowners to conserve their natural
          resources. NRCS employees help land users and communities approach
          conservation planning and implementation with an understanding of how
          natural resources relate to each other and to people—and how human
          activities affect those resources. The agency emphasizes voluntary,
          science-based assistance, partnerships, and cooperative problem
          solving at the community level. The mission of NRCS is to work on the
          Nation&apos;s non-Federal lands to conserve, improve, and sustain
          natural resources. The following functions support the mission.

             Through the conservation operations program, NRCS maintains a cadre
            of conservationists and interdisciplinary technical experts who
            provide landowners with advice and recommendations. Science based
            procedures and techniques are based on new knowledge and research
            provided by the Agricultural Research Service and others. NRCS
            developed and maintains a system of directives—including manuals,
            handbooks, and technical references—to institutionalize new methods,
            procedures, and standards used to deliver technical assistance at
            the field level.

             Soil surveys that provide the public with local information on the
            uses and capabilities of their soil resource. Soil surveys are based
            on scientific analysis and classification of the soils and are used
            to determine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs.
            Surveys are conducted cooperatively with other Federal agencies,
            land grant universities, State agencies, and local units of
            government. NRCS is the world leader in soil classification and soil
            mapping, and is expanding into soil quality.

            variable water supplies. NRCS field staff in cooperation with
            partnering organizations manually collect data from 850 remote high
            mountain sites. Data is electronically collected from an additional
            600 SNOTEL (automated snowpack telemetry network) sites. In
            cooperation with the National Weather Service, the data is assembled
            and analyzed. Then, NRCS staff develop seasonal water supply
            forecasts.
