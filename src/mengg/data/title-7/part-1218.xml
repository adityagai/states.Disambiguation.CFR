             At least once every five years, the Council will review the
            geographical distribution of United States production of blueberries
            and the quantity of imports. The review will be conducted through an
            audit of state crop production figures and Council assessment
            records. If warranted, the Council will recommend to the Secretary
            that the membership on the Council be altered to reflect any changes
            in the geographical distribution of domestic blueberry production
            and the quantity of imports. If the level of imports increases,
            importer members and alternates may be added to the Council.

          Council members and alternates will serve for a term of three years
          and be able to serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. A Council
          member may serve as an alternate during the years the member is
          ineligible for a member position. When the Council is first
          established, the state representatives, first handler member, and
          their respected alternates will be assigned initial terms of three
          years. Regional representatives, the importer member, the exporter
          member, public member, and their alternates will serve an initial term
          of two years. Thereafter, each of these positions will carry a full
          three-year term. Council nominations and appointments will take place
          in two out of every three years. Each term of office will end on
          December 31, with new terms of office beginning on January 1.

            of assessments. That importer may submit documentation to the Board
            and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent organic
            fresh and frozen blueberries—on a form provided by the Council—at
            any time initially and annually thereafter on or before January 1 as
            long as the importer continues to be eligible for the exemption.
            This documentation shall include the same information required of
            producers in paragraph (d) of this section. If the importer complies
            with the requirements of this section, the Council will grant the
            exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the importer. The
            Council will also issue the importer a 9-digit alphanumeric
            Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification valid for 1 year
            from the date of issue. This HTS classification should be entered by
            the importer on the Customs entry documentation. Any line item entry
            of 100 percent organic fresh and frozen blueberries bearing this HTS
            classification assigned by the Council will not be subject to
            assessments.
