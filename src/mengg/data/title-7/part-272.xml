            that applications are taken under the new rules, to convert the
            current caseload to the new program. Households coming due for
            recertification during this time will be converted to the new
            program at recertification. Remaining households shall be converted
            by a desk review during that 4-month period. The new income
            definition, deductions, and allotment calculation shall be completed
            for all households which are converted through a desk review. To the
            extent that the case file and other information available to the
            State agency permit, other eligibility criteria, such as work
            registration, resources, tax dependency, and alien status, shall be
            considered during the desk review. Otherwise, nonincome eligibility
            factors shall be deferred until the household&apos;s scheduled
            recertification. In no event shall a household&apos;s certification
            period be extended as a result of the desk review. Until recertified
            or converted by a desk review, a household shall continue to receive
            the bonus portion of the allotment, calculated in accordance with
            the income, deduction, and basis of issuance provisons of the Food
            Stamp Act of 1964. During the case file conversion period, some
            households may be participating on the basis of the old program
            rules and some on the new rules. Claims against households and
            restoration of benefits shall not be assessed provided that
            whichever program rules are in use for a particular case are
            correctly applied during the conversion period. However, errors

            to four months following the first day that applications are taken
            under the new rules, to convert the current caseload to the new
            program. Households coming due for recertification during

            these households earlier in the four-month period, conversion shall
            take place after the desk review. Further, State agencies may elect
            to do a point-in-time computer conversion in lieu of individual desk
            reviews. Such a computer conversion must cover entire categories of
            households, such as public assistance households, all households in
            a particular project area, all households currently in the computer
            files, etc., and the State agency may not elect to postpone the
            conversion of certain cases until recertification.

             The mail issuance loss rates of 0.75 percent and $2,250 are

            percent and $1,500 are effective October 1, 1983. For the second
            quarter of fiscal year 1983 only, FNS will look at Statewide loss
            rates and the loss rates of individual reporting units within the
            State. Where the loss rate for individual reporting units within the
            State is over the tolerance in that quarter and the Statewide loss
            rate is also over tolerance, FNS will assess liability for losses
            exceeding the tolerance reported for the second quarter of 1983.
            Where the loss rate for individual reporting units within a State
            are over tolerance for the second quarter, but the Statewide loss
            rate is under tolerance, State agencies shall have one additional
            quarter (the third Fiscal Year 1983 quarter) to bring such
            individual reporting units&apos; loss rates into compliance with the
            tolerance levels. Thus for these reporting units, FNS will assess
            liability beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1983 and
            each quarter thereafter for losses which exceed the tolerance
            levels, regardless of Statewide loss rate. FNS will bill State
            agencies for losses on a semiannual basis.

             (enacted December 23, 1985). A “regular session” means a scheduled 
            <PRTPAGE P='672' />
            session of a State&apos;s legislature convened to address the usual
            range of statutory and budgetary issues. A “budgetary” session of a
            legislature shall be considered a “regular session” if State rules
            allow for statutory issues to be introduced at these “budgetary”
            sessions even if rules governing these special procedures are
            stringent.

            narrative justification documenting and explaining the assumptions
            used to arrive at the projections. The narrative shall cover such
            subjects as: The number and salary level of employees; other factors
            affecting personnel costs including anticipated increases in pay
            rates or benefits, and reallocations of staff among units or
            functions, insofar as these might result in cost increases or
            decreases; costs for purchasing, leasing, and maintaining equipment
            and space, especially as concerns any upcoming, one-time-only
            purchases of new capital assets such as ADP equipment, renegotiation
            of leases, changes in depreciation rates or procedures, relocation
            of offices, maintenance and renovation work, and inflation; issuance
            system costs, including renegotiation of issuing agent fees and
            plans to change issuance systems; changes in caseload and factors
            contributing to increases or decreases in the number of
            participants; recertifications, including the anticipated impact of
            economic conditions (and in particular unemployment) and
            seasonality; cost implications of corrective action plans;
            anticipated changes in program regulations and operating guidelines
            and instructions; training needs; travel costs; and adjustments in
            insurance premiums. The narrative should cover as many of the items
            listed above, and any other items deemed relevant by the State
            agency, that will have a significant impact on costs. The State
            agency is not required to discuss every item in the list in every
            submission of a Budget Projection Statement. The narrative should
            concentrate on items that account for increases or decreases in
            costs from the preceding submissions.

             No other changes to the Program fund budget require approval from
            FNS. Examples of changes which do not require Federal approval are:
            The use of State agency funds to accomplish program objectives over
            and above the State agency minimum share included in the approved
            Program budget; and the transfer of amounts budgeted for direct
            costs to absorb authorized increases in indirect costs.

            fraud and need not be physically located in each 5,000 household

             The State agency must obtain racial and ethnic data on
            participating households in the manner specified by FNS. The
            application form must clearly indicate that the information is
            voluntary, that it will not affect the eligibility or the level of
            benefits, and that the reason for the information is to assure that
            program benefits are distributed without regard to race, color, or
            national origin. The State agency must develop alternative means of
            collecting the ethnic and racial data on households, such as by
            observation during the interview, when the information is not
            provided voluntarily by the household on the application form.

             To achieve the efficient and effective administration of the Food
            Stamp Program in rural areas of Alaska, FNS has determined that it
            is necessary to develop additional regulations which are
            specifically designed to accommodate the unique demographic and
            climatic characteristics which exist in these rural areas. The
            regulations established in this section, except for paragraph (f) of
            this section, shall apply only in those areas of Alaska designated
            as “rural” in paragraph (b) of this section. All regulations not
            specifically modified by this section shall remain in effect.

            from the agencies identified in this paragraph (a)(1) and use that
            information in verifying eligibility for and the amount of food
            stamp benefits due to eligible households. Such information may be

             All State agencies are required to sufficiently automate their food
            stamp program operations and computerize their systems for
            obtaining, maintaining, utilizing and transmitting information
            concerning the 
            <PRTPAGE P='708' />
            food stamp program. Sufficient automation levels are those which
            result in effective programs or in cost effective reductions in
            errors and improvements in management efficiency, such as decreases
            in program administrative costs. Thus, for those State agencies
            which operate exceptionally efficient and effective programs, a
            lesser degree of automation may be considered sufficient than in
            other State agencies. In order to determine a sufficient level of
            automation in each State, each State agency shall develop an ADP/CIS
            plan. FNS may withhold State agency funds under 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            than the development of a new system. In assessing the
            practicability of a transfer, State agencies should consult with
            other State agencies that have similar characteristics such as
            whether they are urban or rural, whether they are county or State
            administered, the geographic size of the States and the size of the
            caseload.

             State agencies that plan to automate operations using any method
            other than transfers will need to be able to justify why they are
            not using transfers. The justification will need to include the
            results of the consultations with other State agencies, the relative
            costs of transfer and the system the State agency plans to develop,
            and the reasons for not using a transfer. Common reasons for not
            using transfers include: The State agency is required to use a
            central data processing facility and the (otherwise) transferable
            system is incompatible with it; the State agency&apos;s data base
            management software is incompatible with the transferable system;
            the State agency&apos;s ADP experts are not familiar with the
            software/hardware used by the transferable system and acquiring new
            expertise would be expensive; the transferable system is interactive
            or uses “generic” 
            <PRTPAGE P='709' />
            caseworkers, the receiving State agency does not and it would be
            expensive to modify the existing system and/or procedures; and
            transfer would provoke disputes with the State agency&apos;s
            personnel union. State agencies that cite any of these reasons shall
            not automatically receive approval to develop non-transferred
            systems. State agencies shall show what efforts were considered to
            overcome the problems and that those efforts are cost ineffective.
            This justification will need to be included as part of the Advance
            Planning Document that the State agency must submit for approval of
            its proposed system.
