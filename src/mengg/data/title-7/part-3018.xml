            the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly,

            providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or
            submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section

            allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing

            analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal
