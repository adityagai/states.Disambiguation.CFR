            administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency
            personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter
            the program or activity or would result in undue financial and

             would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that
            compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made
            by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all
            agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of
            the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a
            written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an
            action required to comply with this section would result in such an
            alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action
            that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but
            would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible,
            individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the
            program or activity.
