           means a retail item derived from fish or shellfish that has undergone
          specific processing resulting in a change in the character of the
          covered commodity, or that has been combined with at least one other
          covered commodity or other substantive food component (e.g., breading,
          tomato sauce), except that the addition of a component (such as water,
          salt, or sugar) that enhances or represents a further step in the
          preparation of the product for consumption, would not in itself result
          in a processed food item. Specific processing that results in a change
          in the character of the covered commodity includes cooking (e.g.,
          frying, broiling, grilling, boiling, steaming, baking, roasting),
          curing (e.g., salt curing, sugar curing, drying), smoking (hot or
          cold), and restructuring (e.g., emulsifying and extruding, compressing
          into blocks and cutting into portions). Examples of items excluded
          include fish sticks, surimi, mussels in tomato sauce, seafood medley,
          coconut shrimp, soups, stews, and chowders, sauces, pates, smoked
          salmon, marinated fish fillets, canned tuna, canned sardines, canned
          salmon, crab salad, shrimp cocktail, gefilte fish, sushi, and breaded
          shrimp.

             For sales of a covered commodity in which the customer purchases a
            covered commodity prior to having an opportunity to observe the
            final package (e.g., Internet sales, home delivery sales, etc.), the
            retailer may provide the country of origin notification and method
            of production (wild and/or farm-raised) designation either on the
            sales vehicle or at the time the product is delivered to the
            consumer.
