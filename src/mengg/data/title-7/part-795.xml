          considered to be one person except that such individuals who, prior to
          their marriage, were separately engaged in unrelated farming
          operations will be determined to be separate persons with respect to
          such farming operations so long as the operations remain separate and
          distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse if
          such individuals have executed a Contract to Participate in the 1988
          Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs by April 15, 1988.
          Such individuals must file a form FSA-561 with the county committee
          for each such farming operation by July 8, 1988, if they desire to be
          considered as separate persons under this section.

            A corporation is owned equally by four shareholders. The corporation
            owns land, buildings, and equipment and in the prior year carried
            out substantial farming operations. Three of the shareholders
            propose forming a partnership which they would own equally. The
            partnership would cash lease land and equipment from the corporation

            separate persons for purposes of applying the payment limitation

             Custom farming is the performance of services on a farm such as
            land preparation, seeding, cultivating, applying pesticides, and
            harvesting for hire with remuneration on a unit of work basis,
            except that, for the purpose of applying the provisions of this
            section, the harvesting of crops and the application of agricultural
            chemicals by firms regularly engaged in such businesses shall not be
            regarded as custom farming. A person performing custom farming shall
            be considered as being separate from the person for whom the custom
            farming is performed only if:

          concealing from the county committee any information having a bearing

          If a producer relied on a county committee and/or State committee
          “person” determination for a crop year and higher reviewing authority
          makes a more restrictive determination, the Deputy Administrator may
          grant relief only for such crop year if the producer was not afforded
          an opportunity to exercise other alternatives with respect to the
          producer&apos;s farming operation and the program provisions and the
          county committee has determined that the producers acted in good faith
          based upon the original “person” determination.
