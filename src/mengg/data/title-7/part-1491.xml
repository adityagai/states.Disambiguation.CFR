          of specific high-value food and fiber crops, as determined by the

             Under FRPP, the Chief, on behalf of the CCC, will facilitate and
            provide funding for the purchase of conservation easements or other
            interests in eligible land that is subject to a pending offer from
            an eligible entity for the purpose of protecting the agricultural
            use and related conservation values of the land by limiting
            non-agricultural uses of the land. Eligible entities submit
            applications to NRCS State offices to partner with NRCS to acquire
            conservation easements on farm and ranch land. NRCS enters into
            cooperative agreements with selected entities and provides funds for
            up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the easement. In
            return, the eligible entity agrees to acquire, hold, manage, and
            enforce the easement. A Federal right of enforcement must also be
            included in each FRPP funded easement deed for the protection of the
            Federal investment.

            specific parcels be considered for funding in the next fiscal year.
            Entities must submit a new list of parcels each fiscal year in order
            to be considered for funding unless they request that parcels from
            the previous fiscal year be considered.

             The State Conservationist will use national and State criteria to
            score and rank parcels. The national ranking criteria will be
            established by the Chief, and the State criteria will be determined
            by the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical
            Committee. The national criteria will comprise at least half of the
            ranking system score.

             Under FRPP, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity
            with which NRCS has entered into an FRPP cooperative agreement. The
            easement will require that the easement area be maintained in
            accordance with FRPP goals and objectives for the term of the
            easement.

             Pending offers by an eligible entity must be for acquiring an

            conservation easement, the easement term will be for the maximum
            allowed under State law.

            conservation easement deed, but the conservation easement deed must
            be reviewed and approved by National Headquarters in advance of use.
            Individual conservation easement deeds used by the eligible entity
            will be submitted to National Headquarters at least 90 days before
            the planned closing date. Eligible entities with multiple parcels in
            a cooperative agreement may submit a conservation easement deed
            template for review and approval. The deed templates must be
            reviewed and approved by National Headquarters in advance of use.
            For eligible entities that have not been certified, the NRCS State
            offices will review prior to closing the conservation easement deeds
            for individual parcels to ensure that they contain the same language
            as approved by the national office and that the appropriate
            site-specific information has been included. NRCS reserves the right

            to require additional specific language or to remove language in the
            conservation easement deed to protect the interests of the United
            States. The Chief may exercise the option to promulgate standard
            minimum conservation deed requirements as a condition for receiving
            FRPP funds.

             Impervious surfaces will not exceed 2 percent of the FRPP easement
            area, excluding NRCS-approved conservation practices. The State
            Conservationist may waive the 2 percent impervious surface
            limitation on a parcel-by-parcel basis, provided that no more than
            10 percent of the easement area is covered by impervious surfaces.
            Before waiving the 2 percent limitation, the State Conservationist
            must consider, at a minimum, population density, the ratio of open
            prime other important farmland versus impervious surfaces on the
            easement area, the impact to water quality concerns in the area, the
            type of agricultural operation, and parcel size. Eligible entities
            may submit an impervious surface limitation waiver process to the
            State Conservationist for review and consideration. The eligible
            entities must apply approved impervious surface limitation waiver
            processes on a parcel-by-parcel basis. State Conservationists will
            not approve blanket waivers of the impervious surface limitation for
            all parcels administered by the eligible entity without regard for
            the characteristics of individual parcels. All FRPP easements must
            include language limiting the amount of impervious surfaces within
            the easement area.

             In the event of a violation of the easement terms, the eligible
            entity will notify the landowner. The landowner may be given
            reasonable notice and, where appropriate, an opportunity to
            voluntarily correct the violation in accordance with the terms of
            the conservation easement.

             Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS, upon
            notification to the landowner, reserves the right to enter upon the
            easement area at any time to monitor conservation plan
            implementation or remedy deficiencies or easement violations as it
            relates to the conservation plan. The entry may be made at the
            discretion of NRCS when the actions are deemed necessary to protect
            highly erodible soils and wetland resources. The landowner will be
            liable for any costs incurred by NRCS as a result of the
            landowner&apos;s negligence or failure to comply with the easement
            requirements as it relates to conservation plan violations.

             In instances where an easement is terminated or extinguished, NRCS
            will collect CCC&apos;s share of the conservation easement based on
            the appraised fair market value of the conservation easement at the
            time the easement is extinguished or terminated. The CCC&apos;s
            share will be in proportion to its percentage of original
            investment.

             In the event NRCS determines it must exercise its rights identified
            under a conservation easement or other interest in land, NRCS will
            provide written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested,
            to the eligible entity at the eligible entity&apos;s last known
            address. The notice will set forth the nature of the noncompliance
            by the eligible entity and a 60-day period to cure. If the eligible
            entity fails to cure within the 60-day period, NRCS will take the
            action specified under the notice. NRCS reserves the right to
            decline to provide a period to cure if NRCS determines that imminent
            harm may result to the conservation values or other interest in land
            it seeks to protect.
