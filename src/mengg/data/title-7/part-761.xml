             through 767 describe the Agency&apos;s policies for its Farm Loan
            Programs. The objective of these programs is to provide supervised
            credit and management assistance to eligible farmers to become
            owners or operators, or both, of family farms, to continue such
            operations when credit is not available elsewhere, or to return to
            normal farming operations after sustaining substantial losses as a
            result of a designated or declared disaster. The programs are
            designed to allow those who participate to transition to private
            commercial credit or other sources of credit in the shortest period
            of time practicable through the use of supervised credit, including
            farm assessments, borrower training, market placement, and borrower
            graduation requirements. These regulations apply to loan applicants,
            borrowers, lenders, holders, Agency personnel, and other parties
            involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, or liquidating
            such loans.

            progress at least annually. The review will be in the form of an
            office visit, field visit, letter, phone conversation, or year-end
            analysis, as determined by the Agency. For streamlined CLs, the
            borrower must provide a current balance sheet and income tax
            records. Any negative trends noted between the previous years&apos;
            and the current years&apos; information must be evaluated and
            addressed in the assessment of the streamlined CL borrower.
