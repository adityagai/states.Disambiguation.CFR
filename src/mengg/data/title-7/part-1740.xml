             After an application is found to be eligible, it will be scored in
            three categories: the rurality of the applicant&apos;s core coverage
            area, the average National School Lunch Program eligibility ratio in
            the applicant&apos;s core coverage area, and the critical need for
            the project.

             Scoring in this program is based on a simplified representation of
            the project&apos;s digital coverage area. To find a
            transmitter&apos;s simplified coverage area, go to the FCC TV Query
            Web site (
            <E T='03'>

            ) and access the station Service Contour Map. This map shows
            coverage at the appropriate field strength in dBμ, overlaid on a
            Census Tiger Map. The map also shows counties covered. The core
            coverage area is the set of counties that are either entirely within
            the appropriate coverage contour, or are at least seventy-five
            percent (75%) within the contour. For contours where counties are
            very large with respect to coverage, as might be the case for some
            western states and for most translators, there may be only one
            county within the coverage contour. In such cases, this county is
            the station&apos;s core coverage area. Every transmitter and
            translator must have a core coverage area consisting of one or more
            counties.

             Rurality is a measure of the degree to which a project benefits
            rural areas. Up to fifty (50) points are available in this category.
            Urban areas bisected by the computed contour line are disregarded,
            since they represent fringe viewers. The Rurality score is computed
            as follows:

             The rural population of a core coverage area must be calculated.
            The rural population of a county is calculated by subtracting the
            county&apos;s urban population(s) from the total county population.
            If the core coverage area consists of multiple counties, the rural
            population is the sum of all included counties&apos; rural
            populations. Urban area and county populations may be found at the
            American Factfinder Web site

             The Rurality score is computed by multiplying the rural population
            for the core coverage area by one hundred (100), and subtracting
            fifty (50) from it. If this calculation results in a negative
            number, the Rurality score is zero. The formula is:

             Economic Need will be measured by the ability of the public in an

             The score for Economic Need is computed from the average of the
            National School Lunch Program (NSLP) eligibility percentages for all
            school districts within the core coverage area. NSLP eligibility
            percentage information may be obtained from the state or local
            agency that administers the program, and the application must
            include a certification from this organization that the percentages
            provided are correct. Please note that the score for Economic Need
            is computed from the eligibility percentage, not the participation
            percentage. The score is computed by multiplying the average
            eligibility percentage by 100 (to convert percentage to a whole
            number), subtracting 25, dividing the quotient by two, and limiting
            the result to 25
