          encouraged to pay ahead of schedule, consistent with sound financial

            home planning or budgeting, including plans for debt payment,
            supplemented by effective followup management assistance. Account
            servicing, therefore, must begin with initial planning and must be

             If a borrower owes more than one type of real estate loan, or has
            received initial and subsequent real estate loans on which separate
            accounts are maintained, payments on such accounts should be applied
            so as to maintain the note accounts approximately in balance at the
            end of the year with respect to installments due on the notes, other
            charges, and delinquencies.

             The Finance Office will remit final payments promptly to lenders.
            Other collections (regular, extra, and refunds) applied to a
            borrower&apos;s insured note will be accumulated until the annual
            installment due date, and will be remitted along with any advances
            from the insurance fund to the lender within 30 days after the
            installment due date. All payments to a lender will be credited
            first to interest to the date of the Treasury check and then to
            principal. Since the application of a payment to a borrower&apos;s
            account with the Government and the Government&apos;s account with a
            lender is of a different effective date, the balance owed by a
            borrower to the government and by the Government to a lender
            ordinarily will not be the same.

             Notes which have been reduced to judgment are a part of the court
            records and ordinarily cannot be withdrawn and returned to the
            borrower even after satisfaction of the judgment. Therefore, no
            effort will be made to obtain and return such notes except on the
            written request of the judgment debtor or debtor&apos;s attorney.
            Such requests will be referred to the Office of the General Counsel
            (OGC).

             All promissory notes dated on or after 11-1-73 are held in the
            County Office. A few notes (with the exception of OL notes) are
            still held by investors. If a note dated prior to 11-1-73 cannot be
            located in the County Office and it is needed for servicing the
            case, the County Supervisor will write a memorandum to the Finance
            Office explaining why the note is needed. The request should give
            the name and case number of the borrower, date and original amount
            of the loan, type of loan and loan code.

            to FO and SW insured loans evidenced by promissory note forms
            bearing a form date before January 8, 1959. For all insured loans
            evidenced by note forms bearing a form date of January 8, 1959, or
            later, the insurance charge is called “annual charge” and is
            included in the interest position of the annual installment in the
            note. For a borrower with an insured loan, the term “Installment on
            note and other charge” means the sum of the following:

             The Farm and Home Plan projections for the coming year must show
            that the “balance available to pay debts” exceeds the amount needed
            to pay debts by at least 10 percent before an increase in interest
            rate is put into effect. Borrowers that continually purchase
            unplanned items without the County Supervisor&apos;s approval will
            have the interest rate on their loans increased to the current rate
            for that loan type. Borrowers that fail to provide the County
            Supervisor with the information needed to conduct the analysis
            required in subpart B of part 
            <PRTPAGE P='22' />
            1924 of this chapter will have their interest rate on their loan
            increased to the current rate for the OL, FO, or SW loan as
            applicable. The rate may increase in increments of whole numbers to
            the current regular interest rate for borrowers. In the
            borrower&apos;s case file, the County Supervisor must document the
            unplanned purchases and the failure to provide information in a
            timely manner. The County Supervisor must write the borrower a
            letter which sets out the facts documented in the case file and
            advises the borrower that the interest rate will be increased unless
            the unplanned purchases cease or unless the borrower provides
            information in a timely manner. Whenever it appears that the
            borrower has a substantial increase in income and repayment ability
            or ceases farming, either the interest rate may be increased to the
            current rate for FO, OL or SW loans, as applicable, or the borrower
            will be graduated from the program as provided in subpart F of this
            part.

          Federal debt collection statutes provide for the use of
          administrative, salary, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offsets by
          government agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Rural
          Housing Service (RHS) for its community facility program, and Rural
          Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), herein referred to collectively as
          “United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agency,” to collect
          delinquent debts. Any money that is or may become payable from the
          United States to an individual or entity indebted to a USDA Agency may
          be subject to offset for the collection of a debt owed to a USDA
          Agency. In addition, money may be collected from the debtor&apos;s
          retirement payments for delinquent amounts owed to the USDA Agency if
          the debtor is an employee or retiree of a Federal agency, the U.S.
          Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, or a member of the U.S.
          Armed Forces or the Reserve. Amounts collected will be processed as
          regular payments and credited to the borrower&apos;s account. USDA
          Agencies will process requests by other Federal agencies for offset in
          accordance with 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            § 1951.102 of
          </aref>
           this subpart. This subpart does not apply to direct single family
          housing loans, direct multi-family housing loans, and the Rural
          Utilities Service.

            Section 1951.136 of
          </aref>
           this subpart only applies to RHS for its community facility program
          and RBS for the offset of Federal payments. Nothing in this subpart
          affects the common law right of set off available to USDA Agencies.

          Salary offset.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          Salary offset may be used to collect debts arising from delinquent
          USDA Agency loans and other debts which arise through such activities
          as theft, embezzlement, fraud, salary overpayments, under withholding
          of amounts payable for life and health insurance, and any amount owed
          by former employees from loss of federal funds through negligence and
          other matters. Salary offset may also be used by other Federal
          agencies to collect delinquent debts owed to them by employees of the
          USDA Agency, excluding county committee members. Administrative
          offset, rather than salary offset, will be used to collect money from
          Federal employee retirement benefits. For delinquent Farm Loan
          Programs direct loans, salary offset will not begin until the borrower
          has been notified of servicing options in accordance with 
          <aref type='CFR'>
            7 CFR part 
            <subref title='7' part='766' tq='N'>
              766
            </subref>
          </aref>
          . In addition, for Farm Loan Programs direct loans, salary offset will
          not be instituted if the Federal salary has been considered on the
          farm operating plan, and it was determined the funds were to be used
          for another purpose other than payment on the USDA Agency loan. For
          Farm Loan Programs guaranteed debtors, salary offset can not begin
          until a final loss 
          <PRTPAGE P='25' />
          claim has been paid. When salary offset is used, payment for the debt
          will be deducted from the employee&apos;s pay and sent directly to the
          creditor agency. Not more than 15 percent of the employee&apos;s
          disposable pay can be offset per pay period, unless the employee
          agrees to a larger amount. The debt does not have to be reduced to
          judgment or be undisputed, and the payment does not have to be covered
          by a security instrument. This section describes the procedures which
          must be followed before the USDA Agency can ask a Federal agency to
          offset any amount against an employee&apos;s salary.

             The first step the Certifying Official must take to use this offset
            procedure is to decide, on a case by case basis, whether offset is
            feasible. If an offset is feasible, the directions in the following
            paragraphs of this section will be used to collect by salary offset.
            If the official making this determination decides that salary offset
            is not feasible, the reasons supporting this decision will be
            documented in the borrower&apos;s running case record in the case of
            delinquent debts, or the “For Official Use Only” file in cases of
            other debts. Ordinarily, and where possible, debts should be
            collected in one lump-sum; but payments may be made in installments.
            Installment deductions can be made over a period not greater than
            the anticipated period of employment. However, the amount deducted
            for a pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay
            from which the deduction is made. If possible, the installment
            payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the
            debt in approximately 3 years. Based on the Comptroller
            General&apos;s decisions, other debts by employees cannot be
            forgiven. If the employee retires or resigns, or if employment ends
            before collection of the debt is completed, final salary payment,
            lump-sum leave, etc. may be offset to the extent necessary to
            liquidate the debt. Salary offset is feasible if:

             The cost to the Government of collecting salary offset does not

            from salary offset because the amount collected by salary offset
            would be so small as to be impractical.

            statute of limitations having expired. The Debt Collection Act of
            1982 permits offset of claims that have not been outstanding for
            more than 10 years.

            offset is feasible, the debtor should be notified within 15 calendar
            days after the salary offset determination. This notice will notify
            the debtor of intended salary offset at least 30 days before the
            salary offset begins. For Farm Loan Programs direct loans, this
            notice will be sent after the borrower is over 90 days past due and

             Generally, installment deductions will be made over a period not
            greater than the anticipated period of employment. If possible, the
            installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to
            liquidate the debt in approximately 3 years. The size and frequency
            of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the
            size of the debt and the employee&apos;s ability to pay. Certifying
            Officials are responsible for determining the size and frequency of
            the deductions. However, the amount deducted for any period will not
            exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is
            made, unless 
            <PRTPAGE P='30' />
            the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater
            amount. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50
            a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

             Deductions will be made only from basic pay, incentive pay,
            retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic
            pay, other authorized pay. If there is more than one salary offset,
            the maximum deduction for all salary offsets against an
            employee&apos;s disposable pay is 15 percent unless the employee has
            agreed in writing to a greater amount.

          Any amounts paid by RBS on account of liabilities of a business and
          industry (B&amp;I) program guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a
          Federal debt owing to RBS by the B&amp;I guaranteed loan borrower. In
          such case, the RBS may use all remedies available to it, including
          offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), to
          collect the debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be
          established at the note rate of the guaranteed loan on the date a loss
          claim is paid. RBS may, at its option, refer such debt in all or part
          to the Department of the Treasury, before a final loss claim is
          determined.

            Business-Cooperative Service that has the delegated authority to
            administer the loan or grant program that covers the property or the

             A borrower that is seriously delinquent in loan payments may be
            eligible for loan reamortization with interest rate adjustment. The
            purpose of loan reamortization with interest rate adjustment is to
            provide relief for a borrower that is unable to service the
            outstanding loan in accordance with its existing terms and to
            enhance recovery on the loan. A borrower must meet the conditions of
            this subpart to be considered eligible for this provision.

            income at the time of the sale. The borrower has cooperated in good
            faith, used due diligence to maintain the security against loss, and
            otherwise fulfilled the covenants incident to the loan to the best
            of its ability. Therefore, we recommend that the borrower be
            released from liability upon the completion of the sale.

             For purposes of this subpart, transfers to eligible applicants will
            include mergers and consolidations. Mergers occur when two or more
            corporations combine in such a manner that only one remains in
            existence. In a consolidation, two or more corporations combine to
            form a new, consolidated corporation, with all of the original
            corporations ceasing to exist. In both mergers and consolidations,
            the surviving or emerging corporation takes the assets and assumes
            the liabilities of the corporation(s) which ceased to exist. Such
            transactions must be distinguished from transfers and assumptions,
            in which a transferor will not necessarily go out of existence and
            the transferee will not always take all assets or assume all
            liabilities of the transferor.

           These loan accounts are fully acceptable by Agency standards. Loan
          risk and potential loan servicing costs are higher than would be

          Repayment ability is adequate, and there is a high probability that

             Borrowers are required to supply such financial information as the
            Agency deems necessary to determine whether they are able to
            graduate to other credit. At a minimum, the financial statements
            requested from the borrower must include a balance sheet and a
            statement of income and expenses. Ordinarily, the financial
            statements will be those normally required at the end of the
            particular borrower&apos;s fiscal year. For borrowers who are not
            requested to furnish audited financial statements, the balance sheet
            and statement of income and expenses may be of the borrower&apos;s
            own format if the borrower&apos;s financial situation is accurately
            reflected. The borrower has 60 days for group type loans and 30 days
            for individual type loans to supply the financial information
            requested.

             Borrowers must provide evidence of their ability or inability to

            borrowers, after the date of the request. The Agency may allow
            additional time for good cause, for example when a borrower expects
            to receive income in the near future for the payment of accounts
            which would substantially reduce the amount required for
            refinancing, or when a borrower is a public body and must issue
            bonds to accomplish graduation.

          This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures for servicing
          Community and Business Program loans and/or grants made by Rural
          Development when it is determined that the borrower or grantee was not
          eligible for all or part of the financial assistance received in the
          form of a loan, grant, or subsidy granted, or any other direct
          financial assistance. It does not apply to guaranteed loans. Loans
          sold without insurance by Rural Development to the private sector will
          be serviced in the private sector and will not be serviced under this
          subpart. The provisions of 
          <PRTPAGE P='63' />
          this subpart are not applicable to such loans. Future changes to this
          subpart will not be made applicable to such loans. This subpart does
          not apply to Water and Waste Programs of the Rural Utilities Service,
          Watershed loans, and Resource Conservation and Development Loans,
          which are serviced under

             If the recipient meets with Rural Development, Rural Development
            will outline to the recipient why the assistance was determined to
            be unauthorized. The recipient will be given an opportunity to
            provide information to refute Rural Development&apos;s findings.
            When requested by the recipient, Rural Development may grant
            additional time for the recipient to assemble documentation. Such
            extension of time for payment will be valid only if Rural
            Development documents the extension in writing and specifies the
            period in days during which period the payment obligation created by
            the demand letter (but not the ongoing accrual of interest) will be
            suspended. Interest and other charges will continue to accrue
            pursuant to the demand letter during any extension period unless the
            terms of the demand letter are modified in writing by Rural
            Development.

             On any request for refinancing of a secured loan, the intermediary
            must obtain the previously held collateral as security and must not
            pay off a creditor in excess of the value of the collateral.
            Additional collateral will be required when the refinancing of an
            unsecured loan is unavoidable to accomplish the necessary
            strengthening of the ultimate recipient&apos;s position.

             Loan servicing is intended to be preventive rather than a curative
            action. Prompt followup on delinquent accounts and early recognition
            of potential problems and pursuing a solution to them are keys to
            resolving many problem loan cases.

            recipients. Thereafter, reports will be required semiannually. Also,

            delinquent in repayment of its loan or otherwise fails to fully
            comply with the provisions of its work plan or Loan Agreement, or

          which would impact on the original classification. No one
          classification should be viewed as more important than others. The
