          Service under these regulations may be made available with respect to
          products shipped or received in interstate commerce, and with respect
          to the products not so shipped or received if the Director or Chief
          determines that the furnishing of service for such products would
          facilitate the marketing, distribution, processing, or utilization of
          agricultural products through commercial channels. Also, such service
          may be made available under a cooperative agreement. Service under
          these regulations shall be provided without discrimination as to race,
          color, sex, creed, or national origin. Service will be furnished for
          products only if they were derived from animals slaughtered in

          . Service under these regulations will be furnished for imported meat
          only if it is marked so that the name of the country of origin appears
          on most of the major retail cuts. The mark of foreign origin shall be
          imprinted by roller brand or handstamp and shall be applied so that
          the imprint is at least 2 inches from the backbone of lamb, 3 inches
          from the backbone of veal and calf, and 4 inches from the backbone of
          beef carcasses. The mark of foreign origin shall be repeated parallel
          to the backbone of the carcass so as to appear on each round, rump,
          full loin, rib, and chuck of each bovine and ovine carcass in letters
          at least one-fourth of an inch high, with no more than three-fourths
          of an inch space between impressions. Imprints of each such brand
          shall be submitted to the Chief for the determination of compliance
          with these regulations prior to use of the brand on meats offered for
          Federal grading. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
          notify the meat grade performing the service whenever imported meat is
          offered for grading.

            through Friday, excluding Federal legal holidays occurring Monday
            through Friday on which no grading and certification services are

            , and the Agricultural Marketing Service agrees to make an official
            grader available to perform such service for the applicant. However,
            the Agricultural Marketing Service reserves the right to use any
            grader assigned to a plant under such a commitment to perform
            service for other applicants when, in the opinion of the Chief, the
            grader is not needed to perform service for the commitment
            applicant. An applicant who terminates a commitment, and within 1
            year after cancellation is granted a new commitment at his request,
            shall pay for the moving costs actually incurred by the Agricultural
            Marketing Service to cover the transfer of the grader who will
            service the applicant&apos;s new commitment. If more than one
            applicant is involved in the reapplication for a canceled meat
            grading and certification commitment requiring the transfer of the
            grader, the moving costs will be prorated among the applicants
            according to each applicant&apos;s committed portion of the
            grader&apos;s services. However, the moving costs will be charged
            only to those applicants who were parties to the previously canceled
            commitment. An applicant may, for periods of 3 months or less, enter
            into an agreement by memorandum with the Agricultural Marketing
            Service for the furnishing of service on a weekly basis. In the
            latter case, transfer of graders would not be involved and charges
            will be made in accordance with

             Grading service will only be furnished for meat that a USDA grader
            determines is chilled so that grade factors are developed to the
            extent that a proper grade determination can be made in accordance
            with the official standards. To be eligible for grading, beef
            carcasses must be ribbed at least 10 minutes prior to being offered
            for grading. Meat that is presented in a frozen condition shall not
            be eligible for a grade determination. Meat of all eligible species
            shall be graded only in the establishment where the animal was
            slaughtered or initially chilled (except for veal and calf
            carcasses, which shall be graded only after the hide is removed and
            only in the establishment where such removal occurs). The Director
            may grant prior approval for grading at a location other than the
            establishment of slaughter or initial chill upon notification to the
            Division if the Branch was unable to provide grading service in a
            timely manner and that the meat can be identified in conformance
            with the standards.

             Appeal service is a redetermination of the class, grade, other
            quality, or compliance of product when the applicant for the appeal
            service formally challenges the correctness of the original
            determination. Only a person who has title to, or is a party to a
            contract for the sale of, a product may request appeal service with
            respect to such product and if the original determination of class,
            grade, other quality or compliance is found on appeal to have been
            in error all incorrect marks of class, grade, other quality and
            compliance will be removed from the product, and if the person
            having title to the product so requests, correct marks as determined
            on the appeal will be applied to the product. Examination requested
            to determine the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of a

            any question as to the correctness of the original service for the
            product involved shall be considered equivalent to original service

          Immediately after appeal service has been performed for any products,
          a certificate designated as an “appeal certificate” shall be prepared,
          signed, and issued referring specifically to the original certificate
          and stating the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of the
          products as shown by the appeal service.

          The appeal certificate shall supersede the original certificate which,

          deemed to show the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of the
          products described therein. However, the fees charged for the original
          service shall not be remitted. If the original and all copies of the
          superseded certificate are not delivered to the official with whom the
          request for appeal service is filed, the official graders issuing the
          appeal certificate shall forward notice of such issuance and of the
          cancellation of the original certificate to such persons as they may
          deem necessary to prevent fraudulent use of the superseded
          certificate.

          When an official grader, supervisor of grading, or other responsible
          employee of the Branch has evidence of misgrading, or of incorrect
          certification or other incorrect determination or identification as to
          the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of a product, he shall
          report the matter to his immediate supervisor. The supervisor of
          grading will investigate the matter and, if he deems advisable, will
          report it to the owner or his agent. The supervisor of grading shall
          take appropriate action to correct errors found in the determination
          or identification of class, grade or other quality or compliance of
          products if the products are still owned by the person who owned them
          when, and are still located at the establishment where, the incorrect
          service was rendered and if such service was rendered by a grader
          under the jurisdiction of such supervisor, and the supervisor of
          grading shall take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of such
          errors.

          When a design review specialist, supervisor, or other responsible
          employee of the Branch has evidence of inaccurate evaluation, or of
          incorrect certification or other incorrect determination or
          identification as to the compliance of a piece of equipment or
          utensil, such person shall report the matter to the Chief. The Chief
          will investigate the matter and, if deemed advisable, will report any
          material errors to the owner or the owner&apos;s agent. The Chief
          shall take appropriate action to correct errors found in the
          determination of compliance of equipment or utensils, and the Chief
          shall take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors.
