             USDA awarding agencies occasionally develop grant provisions that
            are inconsistent with this part. USDA attempts to keep these
            provisions to a minimum by internal procedures that require these
            provisions to be justified to appropriate officials of USDA and OMB.
            If the conflicting provisions are of long-term and general
            applicability, O&amp;F may require that the awarding agency (1)
            publish the conflicting provision as a notice in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register
            </E>
             and (2) give the public an opportunity to comment before making the
            regulations final.

          In these cases the awarding agency may impose special conditions that
          are more restrictive than otherwise permitted by this part. If so, the
          awarding agency must tell the recipient in writing why it is imposing
          the special conditions and what corrective action is needed.

             The retention period starts from the date of the submission of the
            final expenditure report or, where USDA grant support is continued
            or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 3-year retention period
            for the records of each funding period starts on the day the
            recipient submits to USDA its annual or final expenditure report for
            that period. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 3-year
            retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.

             General program income shall be retained by the recipient and used
            in accordance with one or a combination of the alternatives in
            paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as follows: The
            alternative in paragraph (c) may always be used by recipients and
            must be used if neither of the other two alternatives is permitted
            by the provisions of the grant award. The alternatives in paragraph
            (d) or (e) of this section may be used only if expressly permitted
            by the provisions of 
            <PRTPAGE P='125' />
            the grant award. In specifying alternatives that may be used, the
            provisions of the grant award may distinguish between income earned
            by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the
            sources, kinds, or amounts of income.

            alternative in paragraph (c) of this section shall always be
            permitted.

             Under this alternative, the income is used for allowable costs of
            the project or program. If there is a cost-sharing or matching
            requirement, costs supported by the income may not count toward
            satisfying that requirement. Therefore, the maximum percentage of
            Federal cost-sharing is applied to the net amount determined by
            deducting the income from total allowable costs and third party
            in-kind contributions. The income shall be used for current costs
            unless the awarding agency authorizes the income to be used in a
            later period.

             To illustrate this alternative, assume a project in which the
            recipient incurs $100,000 of allowable costs and receives no third
            party in-kind contributions. If the recipient earns $10,000 in
            general program income and this alternative applies, that $10,000
            must be deducted from the $100,000 before applying the maximum
            percentage of Federal cost-sharing. If that percentage is 90
            percent, the most that could be paid to the recipient would
            therefore be $81,000 (90 percent times $90,000).

             Under this alternative, the income is used for allowable costs of

            requirement. Therefore, the maximum percentage of Federal
            cost-sharing is applied to total allowable costs and third party
            in-kind contributions. The income shall be used for current costs

            to the full $100,000, and $90,000 could therefore be paid to the
            recipient.

             Under this alternative, the income is used for costs which are in
            addition to the allowable costs of the project or program but which
            nevertheless further the objectives of the Federal statute under
            which the grant was made. Provided that the costs supported by the
            income further the broad objectives of that statute, they need not
            be of a kind that would be permissible as charges to Federal funds.
            Examples of purposes for which the income may be used are:

            seller, exhibitor, or performer of the copyrighted work. In some
            cases the recipient incurs costs to earn the income but does not

             Except when exempted by Federal statute (see paragraph (b) of this
            section for the principal exemption), recipients shall remit to the
            Federal government any interest or other investment income earned on
            advances of USDA grant funds. This includes any interest or
            investment income earned by subrecipients and cost-type contractors

            the recipient. Unless the recipient receives other instructions from

            amount due by check or money order payable to the awarding agency.

            rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost-sharing or
            matching. In the case of a subgrant, the provisions of the USDA
            grant should require that the approval be obtained from the awarding
            agency as well as the recipient. In all cases, the approval may be
            given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land
            would be approved as an allowable direct cost.

             If approval is not obtained under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,
            no amount shall be counted for donated land. Instead, only
            depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment
            and buildings and treated as costs incurred by the recipient. They
            are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance
            with the cost principles specified in Subpart T of this part. They
            will thus be handled in the same way as depreciation or use
            allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of
            depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings
            is based on the property&apos;s market value at the time it was
            donated.

          In some cases, it will be necessary to establish the market value of
          land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a
          building. In these cases, the awarding agency must require that the
          market value or fair rental rate be set by an independent appraiser
          (or by a representative of the U.S. General Services Administration,
          if available) and that the value or rate be certified by a responsible
          official of the party to 
          <PRTPAGE P='129' />
          which the property or its use is donated. This requirement must also

             Awarding agencies may extend the due date for any financial report
            upon receiving a justified request from the recipient. The recipient
            should not wait until the due date if an extension is to be
            requested, but should submit the request as soon as the need becomes
            known. Failure by a recipient to submit a report by its due date may
            result in severe enforcement actions by USDA. These may include
            withholding of further grant payments, suspension or termination of
            the grant, etc. Therefore recipients are urged to submit reports on
            time.

             Recipients shall submit the report no later than 15 working days
            following the end of each quarter. However, the USDA payment office
            may require recipients receiving advances of one million dollars or
            more per year to submit a report within 15 working days following
            the end of each month. Awarding agencies may waive the requirement
            for submission of the SF-272 when monthly advances do not exceed
            $10,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored
            through other forms contained in this subpart, or if, in the
            awarding agency&apos;s opinion, the recipient&apos;s accounting
            controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances.

             Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, payments for proper
            charges incurred by recipients will not be withheld at any time
            during the grant period unless (1) the recipient has failed to
            comply with the program objectives, grant award conditions, or
            Federal reporting requirements, or (2) the recipient is indebted to
            the United States and collection of the indebtedness will not impair
            accomplishment of the objectives of any grant program sponsored by
            the United States, or (3) the grant is suspended pursuant to subpart
            N of this part.

             Payments withheld for failure of a recipient to comply with
            reporting requirements, but without suspension of the grant, will be
            released to the recipient upon subsequent compliance. When a grant
            is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with
            subpart N of this part. When a debt is to be collected, USDA
            awarding agencies may withhold payments or require appropriate
            accounting adjustments to recorded cash balances for which the
            recipient is accountable to the Federal government, in order to
            liquidate the indebtedness.

             Recipients shall be responsible for reviewing requests from their
            subrecipients for the approvals required by this subpart and for
            giving or denying the approval. A recipient shall not approve any
            action which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms of the
            Federal grant or cooperative agreement. If an action by a
            subrecipient will result in a change in the overall grant project or
            budget requiring approval from the awarding agency, the recipient
            shall obtain that approval before giving its approval to the
            subrecipient. Approvals shall not be valid unless they are in
            writing and signed by an authorized official of the recipient
            organization.

             For research and non-research projects which involve cost-sharing
            or matching, approved budgets shall ordinarily consist of a single
            set of figures covering total project cost (the sum of the awarding
            agency&apos;s share and the recipient&apos;s share). However, the
            awarding agency may specify that the recipient&apos;s share not be
            included in the approved budget. In no case, however, shall the
            approved budget be in the form of a separate set of figures for each
            share.

            functions, or types of activities). In these cases, the awarding
            agency may require that the approved budget be subdivided to show
            the anticipated cost of each programmatic segment.

            Circular A-110) are not a required part of the grant or subgrant
            closeout procedures. Normally, a final audit should not be needed
            unless there are problems with a grant or subgrant that require
            audit attention. If a USDA agency considers a final audit to be
            necessary, it shall contact the OIG Region within which the
            recipient or subrecipient is located and inform OIG of the
            situation. OIG shall be responsible for assuring that necessary
            final audits are performed and for any necessary coodination with
            other Federal cognizant audit agencies, recipients or State and
            local auditors. Audits performed in accordance with subpart I may
            serve as final audits providing such audits meet the needs of the
            requesting agency.

            corrective action required of the recipient, and the effective date.
            Suspension may go into effect immediately if the awarding agency
            deems it necessary to protect its interest and if a delayed
            effective date would be unreasonable considering the awarding
            agency&apos;s responsibilities to protect the Federal
            government&apos;s interest. Suspension shall remain in effect until
            the recipient has taken corrective action satisfactory to the
            awarding agency, or given evidence that such corrective action will
            be taken, or until the awarding agency terminates the grant.

          When original or replacement equipment is no longer to be used in
          projects or programs currently or previously sponsored by the Federal
          government, disposal of the equipment shall be made as follows:

            case, if the equipment is sold, $100 or 10 percent of the total
            sales proceeds, whichever is greater, may be deducted and retained
            from the amount otherwise due for selling and handling expenses. If
            the recipient&apos;s project or program for which or under which the
            equipment was acquired is still receiving grant support from the
            same Federal program and if the awarding agency approves, the net
            amount due may be used for allowable costs of that project or
            program. Otherwise, the net amount must be returned to the awarding
            agency by check or money order.

             Except as explained in the following paragraphs of this section,
            the Federal share of the property shall be the same percentage as
            the Federal share of the acquiring party&apos;s total cost under the
            grant during the grant or subgrant year (or other funding period) to
            which the acquisition cost of the property was charged. For this
            purpose, “costs under the grant” means allowable costs which are
            either supported by the grant or counted toward satisfying a
            cost-sharing or matching requirement of the grant.

             If the property is acquired by a subrecipient, the Federal share of
            the subrecipient&apos;s costs under the grant and hence of the
            property shall be calculated by multiplying the Federal share of the
            recipient&apos;s costs by the latter&apos;s share of the
            subrecipient&apos;s costs. (For example, if the Federal share of the
            recipient&apos;s costs is 50 percent and the subgrant bears only 50
            percent of a subrecipient&apos;s costs, then the Federal share of
            that subrecipient&apos;s costs (and of the property acquired by that
            subrecipient) is 25 percent.)

             The provisions of some grant awards set different maximum
            percentages of Federal financial participation for different
            categories of costs. In these cases, for the purposes of this
            section, the costs in each category are considered as costs under a
            separate grant. If two categories have the same maximum percentage
            of Federal participation and costs in one category are permitted to
            count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of
            the other, they are a single category for the purposes of this rule.
            Also, all categories with a 100 percent rate are considered a single
            category for the purposes of this rule.

          This subpart makes the allowable costs incurred by the recipient the
          maximum amount of money a recipient is entitled to receive from USDA.
          In addition, this subpart identifies the principles to be used in
          determining allowable costs. These cost principles shall apply to
          transactions and activities conducted under grants, subgrants,
          cooperative agreements, cost-type contracts and cost-type subcontracts
          under grants.

            exceed the allowable costs incurred by the recipient for those
            activities.

             The recipient&apos;s allowable costs include allowable outlays, if
            any, to its subrecipients and contractors. If the recipient pays a
            subrecipient more than the allowable costs incurred by the
            subrecipient, the excess is not an allowable cost of the recipient
            and may not be included as part of the maximum allowable costs
            charged to USDA. However, for cost-type contracts a reasonable fee
            or profit paid by the recipient to the contractor, in addition to
            the contractor&apos;s allowable costs, may be included in this
            maximum unless prohibited by the provisions of the grant award.

          USDA cost principles applicable to a cost-type contractor or a
          subrecipient will not necessarily be the same as those applicable to
          the recipient. For example, where a State government awards a
          subrecipient or cost-type contract to an institution of higher
          education, OMB Circular A-21 would apply to the costs incurred by the
          institution of higher education even though OMB Circular A-87 would
          apply to the costs incurred by the State.

          Each set of cost principles specifically identifies certain costs
          that, in order to be allowable, must be approved by the awarding
          agency. Other costs do not require approval. The following procedures
          govern approval of these costs:

            costs as part of the indirect cost rate or cost allocation plan

            procedures of subpart M shall be followed, except that, for formula

            requirements or tests for allowability specified by the applicable
            cost principles, such as reasonableness and necessity, the costs may
            be disallowed.

            (or a designated representative of the Head) of the government
            agency which is primarily responsible for administering or carrying
            out the project or program. If the designated representative is
            personally involved in the project or program under consideration,
            the approval may be given only by the Head. If the Head is
            personally involved in the project or program under consideration,
            prior approval from the awarding agency is required. Such prior
            approval must include a determination that the applicable
            requirements in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section are
            present.

             If any or all of the awards are likely to be cooperative agreements
            rather than grants, the program announcement so states. In that
            case, if feasible, the program announcement also describes the
            anticipated substantial Federal involvement in performance. (This
            paragraph does not prevent the award of cooperative agreements under
            a program announcement that mentioned only grants. Nor does it
            prevent the award of grants under a program announcement that
            mentioned only cooperative agreements.)
