            audits of such systems for small farmers, packers and processors;
            investing in specialty crop research, including organic research to
            focus on conservation and environmental outcomes; enhancing food
            safety; developing new and improved seed varieties and specialty
            crops; pest and disease control; and sustainability.

        <P>
          Each year that a State receives a grant under the SCBGP-FB, the State
          is required to conduct an audit of the expenditures of SCBGP-FB funds.
          If the Single Audit Act applies to an eligible grantee, the State
          shall submit the annual audit results to AMS within 30 days after
          completion of the audit. If the Single Audit Act does not apply, the
          State shall conduct an audit of all SCBGP-FB funds no later than 60
          days after the end date of the grant agreement. The State shall submit
          to AMS not later than 30 days after completion of the audit, a copy of
          the audit results.
