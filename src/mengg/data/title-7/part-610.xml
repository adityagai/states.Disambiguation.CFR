             Technical assistance is provided through and in cooperation with
            conservation districts in the 50 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto
            Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These districts, formed under
            authority of State laws, are operated and controlled by local
            citizens. They provide the leadership and the program needed to meet
            the conservation objectives of the district.

             NRCS furnishes technical assistance to conservation districts as

            assigned to conservation districts work directly with land users and
            others according to the program needs and the priorities established
            by the conservation districts.

            help includes onsite planning assistance in making conservation
            plans. The plans are based on a soil survey and interpretations for
            the intended land uses and conservation treatment. Plans may also
            include other inventories of soil, water, plant, and related
            resources needed in the planning process. Information about the
            responses of each kind of soil and the conservation practices and
            resource management needed for different land uses is provided. The
            land user&apos;s decisions recorded in the plan are based on his
            conservation objectives. Conservation plans provide for the orderly
            installation of conservation practices. Conservation plans reflect
            changing conditions.

          Technical assistance is based on the principle that soil, water,
          plant, and related resources are interdependent and must be managed
          accordingly. Soil conservationists integrate the various technical
          fields in providing for the conservation of land and water resources.
          Staff scientists and specialists develop conservation standards,
          prepare necessary specifications, provide training, and review work
          performance, NRCS uses consultants for conservation problems that
          require special expertise.

             The equation for predicting soil loss due to wind in the Wind
            Erosion Equation (WEQ) is E = f(IKCLV). (For further information on
            WEQ see the paper by N.P. Woodruff and F.H. Siddaway, 1965. “A Wind
            Erosion Equation,” Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, Vol.
            29, No. 5, pages 602-608, which is available from the American
            Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wisconsin. In addition, the use of the
            WEQ in NRCS is explained in the Natural Resources Conservation

             is the soil erodibility index. It is the potential for soil loss
            from a wide, level, unsheltered, isolated field with a bare, smooth,
            loose and uncrusted surface. Soil erodibility is based on soil
            surface texture, calcium carbonate content, and percent day.

            values that were contained in the local Field Office Technical Guide

             In accordance with the guidelines in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)
            of this section, it is the responsibility of the State
            Conservationist to seek a balanced representation of interests among
            the membership on the State Technical Committee. Individuals or
            groups wanting to participate on a State Technical Committee within
            a specific State may submit a request to the State Conservationist
            that explains their interest and outlines their credentials which
            they believe are relevant to becoming a member. Decisions regarding
            membership are at the discretion of the State Conservationist. State
            Conservationist decisions on membership are final and not appealable
            to any other individual or group within USDA.

             NRCS will establish and maintain national standard operating
            procedures governing the operation of State Technical Committees and
            Local Working Groups in its directive system. The standard operating
            procedures will outline items such as: The best practice approach to
            establishing, organizing, and effectively utilizing State Technical
            Committees and Local Working Groups; direction on publication of
            State Technical Committee and Local Working Group meeting notices
            and agendas; State Technical Committee meeting summaries; how to
            provide feedback on State Conservationist decisions regarding State
            Technical Committee recommendations; and other items as determined

             In addition to the standard operating procedures established under
            paragraph (b) of this section, the State Conservationist will
            provide public notice and allow public attendance at State Technical
            Committee and Local Working Group meetings. The State
            Conservationist will publish a meeting notice no later than 14
            calendar days prior to a State Technical Committee meeting.
            Notification may exceed this 14-day minimum where State open meeting
            laws exist and provide for a longer notification period. This
            minimum 14-day notice requirement may be waived in the case of
            exceptional conditions, as determined by the State Conservationist.
            The State Conservationist will publish this notice in at least one
            or more newspaper(s), including recommended Tribal publications, to
            attain statewide circulation.

             Each State Technical Committee established under this subpart will
            meet on a regular basis, as determined by the State Conservationist,
            to provide information, analysis, and recommendations to appropriate
            officials of USDA who are charged with implementing and establishing
            priorities and criteria for natural resources conservation
            activities and programs under Title XII of the Food Security Act of
            1985 including, but not limited to, the Conservation Reserve
            Program, Wetlands Reserve Program, Conservation Security Program,
            Conservation Stewardship Program, Farm and Ranch Lands Protection
            Program, Grassland Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives

            natural resource conservation programs and issues as may be
            requested by the State Conservationist or other USDA agency heads at

             The role of the State Technical Committee is advisory in nature,
            and the committee will have no implementation or enforcement
            authority. The implementing agency reserves the authority to accept
            or reject the committee&apos;s recommendations. However, the
            implementing USDA agency will give strong consideration to the State
            Technical Committee&apos;s recommendations.

             In some situations, specialized subcommittees, made up of 
            <PRTPAGE P='454' />
            State Technical Committee members, may be needed to analyze and
            examine specific issues. The State Conservationist may assemble
            certain members, including members of Local Working Groups and other
            knowledgeable individuals, to discuss, examine, and focus on a
            particular technical or programmatic topic. The subcommittee may
            seek public participation, but it is not required to do so.
            Nevertheless, recommendations resulting from these subcommittee
            sessions, other than sessions of Local Working Groups, will be made
            only in a general session of the State Technical Committee where the

            landowners and managers who request assistance based on
            locally-established priorities and resource concerns. The purpose of
            the CPGL Program is to provide technical assistance to private
            grazing land owners and managers to voluntarily conserve or enhance
            grazing land resources to meet ecological, economic, and social
            demands.

             Provide technical assistance to grazing-land owners and managers to
            plan and implement resource conservation on grazing land. The
            objective of planning on grazing land is to assist landowners and
            managers in understanding the basic ecological principles associated
            with managing their land. This objective can be met by implementing
            a plan that meets the needs of the resources (soil, water, air,
            plants, and animals) and management objectives of the owner or
            manager. NRCS may provide assistance, at the request of the private
            grazing-land owner or manager to:
