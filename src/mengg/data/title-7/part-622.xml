            and Pub. L. 78-534 are the same in most cases. Planning criteria,

            arrangements for the Pub. L. 78-534 program are consistent with
            those of the Pub. L. 83-566 program. The differences with the Pub.

             Flood prevention projects are individually authorized by Federal

            only in that program funds may be used for the purchase of land
            rights for single-purpose flood prevention structures and installing
            land treatment on Federal lands.

        <P>
          Upon receipt of an application, the NRCS will make any necessary field
          studies and develop a report to justify the need for planning effort.
          Once planning is authorized by the Chief of NRCS, a watershed
          plan-environmental impact statement (plan-EIS) or a watershed
          plan-environmental assessment (plan-EA) will be prepared by NRCS to
          request funding. This effort must be coordinated with other State and
          Federal agencies.

             The watershed plan-environmental impact statement (or assessment)
            will be subject to internal technical reviews, sponsor and other
            local party review, interagency review by other Federal, state, and
            concerned groups, and a final review as stated in NRCS&apos;s
            National Watersheds Manual.

             After thorough review by NRCS and other agencies, the NRCS and the
            sponsors shall accept the plan-EIS or plan-EA by signing the
            watershed agreement. The watershed plan must be approved by the
            Committees of Congress or the Chief of NRCS. Funding for
            installation can then be granted by the Chief of NRCS.
