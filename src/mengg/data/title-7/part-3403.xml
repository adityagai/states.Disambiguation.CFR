          funds. The purpose of the third phase is to pursue the commercial

             Phase I involves a solicitation of grant applications (hereinafter
            referred to as proposals) to conduct feasibility-related
            experimental research and development related to described agency
            requirements. These requirements, as defined by agency topics
            contained in the solicitation, may be general or narrow in scope,
            depending on USDA needs. The object of this phase is to determine
            the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed
            effort and the quality of performance of the small business concern
            with a relatively small agency investment before consideration of
            further Federal support in Phase II.

             is the principal research or research and development effort in

            pursued, normally for a period not to exceed 24 months. Only SBIR
            awardees in Phase I are eligible to participate in Phase II. This
            includes those awardees identified via a “novated” or “successor in
            interest” or similarly-revised funding agreement, or those that have
            reorganized with the same key staff, regardless of whether they have
            been assigned a different tax identification number. For each Phase
            I project funded, the awardee may apply for a Phase II award only
            once. Phase I awardees who for valid reasons cannot apply for Phase
            II support in the next fiscal year funding cycle may normally apply
            for support no later than the second fiscal year funding cycle.

             refers to work that derives from, extends, or logically concludes
            effort(s) performed under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is
            funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is
            typically oriented towards commercialization of SBIR research or
            technology. This portion of a project is funded by a non-SBIR source
            through the use of a follow-on funding commitment. A follow-on
            funding commitment is an agreement between the small business
            concern and a provider of the follow-on capital for a specified
            amount of funds to be made available to the small business concern
            for future development of their effort upon achieving certain
            mutually agreed upon technical objectives.

             Proposals must cover only scientific/technological research
            activities. A small business concern must not propose product
            development, technical assistance, demonstration projects,
            classified research, or patent applications. Many of the research
            projects supported by the SBIR program lead to the development of
            new products based upon the research results obtained during the
            project. However, projects that seek funding solely for product
            development where no research is involved,

            previously completed research, will not be accepted. Literature
            surveys should be conducted prior to preparing proposals for
            submission and must not be proposed as a part of the SBIR Phase I or
            Phase II effort. Proposals principally for the development of proven
            concepts toward commercialization or for market research should not
            be submitted since such efforts are considered the responsibility of
            the private sector and therefore are not supported by USDA.

             A proposal must be limited to only one topic. The same proposal may
            not be submitted under more than one topic as defined in the
            solicitation. However, an organization may submit separate proposals
            on the same topic. Where similar research is discussed under more
            than one topic, the proposer should choose that topic whose
            description appears most relevant to the proposer&apos;s research
            concept. USDA will not consider funding duplicate (essentially
            equivalent work) proposals. In addition, essentially equivalent work
            funded by another entity will be returned to the applicant without
            review.

             WARNING—While it is permissible with proposal notification to
            submit identical proposals containing a significant amount of
            essentially equivalent work for consideration under numerous Federal
            program solicitations, it is unlawful to enter into funding
            agreements requiring essentially equivalent work. If there is any
            question concerning this, it must be disclosed to the soliciting
            agency or agencies before award. If an applicant elects to submit
            identical proposals or proposals containing a significant amount of
            essentially equivalent work under other Federal program
            solicitations, a statement must be included in each such proposal

             If the proposed research will include laboratory animals or human

            plan reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use

            commencing actual substantive work. If such approval is required,
            USDA may not release funds for the award until proper documentation

             USDA, by law, is required to make the final decision as to whether

            proposals received; extra copies will be destroyed. Public release
            of information for any proposal submitted will be subject to
            existing statutory and regulatory requirements. Any proposal which
            is funded will be considered an integral part of the award and
            normally will be made available to the public upon request through
            the Freedom of Information Act, except for designated proprietary
            information.

             The inclusion of proprietary information is discouraged unless it
            is necessary for the proper evaluation of the proposal. If
            proprietary information is to be included, it should be limited, set
            apart from other text on a separate page, and keyed to the text by
            numbers. It should be confined to a few critical technical items
            which, if disclosed, could jeopardize the obtaining of foreign or
            domestic patents. Trade secrets, salaries, or other information
            which could jeopardize commercial competitiveness should be
            similarly keyed and presented on a separate page. Proposals or
            reports which attempt to restrict dissemination of large amounts of
            information may be found unacceptable by USDA.

            technical and scientific approaches. Each proposal will be judged on
            its own merit. USDA is under no obligation to fund any proposal or
            any specific number of proposals in a given topic. It also may elect
            to fund several or none of the proposed approaches to the same topic

             External peer reviewers may be used during the technical evaluation
            stage of this process. Selections will be made from among recognized
            specialists who are uniquely qualified by training and experience in
            their respective fields to render expert advice on the merit of
            proposals received. It is anticipated that such experts will include
            those located in universities, government, and nonprofit research
            organizations. If possible, USDA intends that peer review groups
            shall be balanced with minority and female representation and with

             Reviewers will base their conclusions and recommendations on

            referred to within a proposal, with key individuals, or with the
            firm itself. Therefore, the proposals should be self-contained and

            USDA requirements, resubmission and budget limitation. In the event
            that two or more proposals are of approximately equal merit, the
            existence of a cooperative research and development agreement
            (CRADA) with a USDA laboratory will 
            <PRTPAGE P='386' />
            be an important consideration. The existence of a follow-on funding
            commitment for continued development in Phase III will also be an
            important consideration. The value of any commitment will depend
            upon the degree of financial commitment made by investors, with the
            maximum value resulting from a signed agreement with reasonable
            terms for an amount at least equal to funding requested from USDA in
            Phase II.

          The beginning of the project period shall be no later than September

             The project period may be extended by NIFA without additional
            financial support, for such additional period(s) as the ADO
            determines may be necessary to complete or fulfill the purposes of
            an approved project provided Federal funds remain. Any extension of
            time shall be conditioned upon prior request by the grantee and
            approval in writing by the ADO unless otherwise noted in the award
            terms and conditions. In such cases the extension will not normally
            exceed 12 months. The Phase I award will still be limited to the
            approved award amount, and the submission of a Phase II proposal
            will normally be delayed by no more than one year. The extension
            allows the grantee to continue expending the remaining Federal funds
            for the intended purpose over the extension period. In instances
            where no Federal funds remain, it is unnecessary to approve an
            extension since the purpose of the extension is to continue using
            Federal funds. The grantee may opt to continue the Phase I project
            after the grant&apos;s termination and closeout, however, the
            grantee would have to do so without additional Federal funds. In the
            latter case, no communication with USDA is necessary.

             Occasionally, after an award has been made the name of the Awardee
            may change. NIFA requires execution of a “Change of Name Agreement”
            in such instances. The specific circumstances of each situation will
            determine which kind of agreement should be executed. This decision
            will be determined by the ADO.

             A Change of Name Agreement is a legal instrument executed by the
            Awardee and the Government that recognizes a change of the legal
            name of the Awardee without disturbing the original rights and
            obligations of the parties. If only a change of the Awardee&apos;s
            name is involved and the Government&apos;s and Awardee&apos;s rights
            and obligations remain unaffected, the parties should execute an
            agreement to reflect the name change.

             A Novation Agreement is a legal instrument executed by the Grantee
            (transferor), the successor in interest (transferee), and the
            Government by which, among other things, the transferor guarantees
            performance of the award, the transferee assumes all obligations
            under the award, and the Government recognizes the transfer of the
            award and related assets. This occurs when the third party&apos;s
            interest in the award arises out of the transfer of all the
            Grantee&apos;s assets or the entire portion of the assets involved
            in performing the award. Examples include, but are not limited to:
            the sale of these assets with a provision for assuming liabilities;
            the transfer of these assets incident to a merger or corporate
            consolidation; and the incorporation of a proprietorship or
            partnership, or the formation of a partnership.

          <P>
            2. The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform each award in

            were the original party to the awards.

            3. The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the

            the Transferee.
          </P>
          <P>

            All payments and reimbursements made by the Government after the
            date of this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall
            have the same force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and
            shall constitute a complete discharge of the Government&apos;s
            obligations under the awards, to the extent of the amounts paid or
            reimbursed.
          </P>
          <P>
            7. The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is
            not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise
            give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related
            increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from
            the transfer or this Agreement, other than those that the Government
            in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been
            obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the awards.
          </P>
          <P>
            8. The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the
            performance of all obligations that the Transferee (i) assumes under
            this Agreement or (ii) may undertake in the future should these
            awards be modified under their terms and conditions. The Transferor
            waives notice of, and consents to, any such future modifications.
          </P>
          <P>
            9. The awards shall remain in full force and effect, except as
            modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement
