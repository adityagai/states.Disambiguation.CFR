            State Soybean Board operating in the State in which the first
            purchaser is located shall remit such assessments to the Qualified
            State Soybean Board operating in the State in which the soybeans
            were grown. If no such Qualified State Soybean Board exists in such
            State, then the assessments shall be remitted to the Board. The
            Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may authorize Qualified
            State Soybean Boards to propose modifications to the foregoing
            “State of Origin” rule to ensure effective coordination of
            assessment collections between Qualified State Soybean Boards.

            of the county committee. If two or more of the counties have been
