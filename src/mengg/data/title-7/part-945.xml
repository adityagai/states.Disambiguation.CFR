          may find are reasonable and likely to be incurred during each fiscal
          period for its maintenance and functioning, and for 
          <PRTPAGE P='292' />
          such purposes as the Secretary, pursuant to this subpart, determines
          to be appropriate. Handlers shall share such expenses upon the basis
          of a fiscal period. Each handler&apos;s share of such expense shall be
          proportionate to the ratio between the total quantity of potatoes
          handled by him as the first handler thereof during a fiscal period and
          the total quantity of potatoes handled by all handlers as first
          handlers thereof during the same period.

            income.

        <P>
          The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of
          potatoes for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to
          determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and
          regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee
          finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with
          requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in
          special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or
          Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and
          further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and
          not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee
          but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding
          fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied
          may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his
          disqualification.

             Inspection certificates, numbered notesheets or shipping clearance
            reports for potatoes to be shipped must be issued within four days

            performed to verify that the potatoes meet the requirements
            specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. If the
            subsequent inspection verifies that the lot meets the requirements
            of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a new certificate,
            a new numbered notesheet, or a new shipping clearance report shall
            be issued and, if positive lot identified, shall reference the
            original PLI number, and a new PLI number need not be applied to the
            lot. However, if upon subsequent inspection, the lot does not meet
            the requirements specified in either paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of
            this section, the lot shall be reconditioned in the presence of an
            authorized representative of the Idaho Federal-State Inspection
            Service or Oregon Federal-State Inspection Service prior to the
            close of the business day. If the lot is reconditioned prior to the
            close of the business day, a new certificate, a new numbered
            notesheet, or a new shipping clearance report must be issued, and
            either a new PLI number must be applied to the lot or the original
            PLI number must be modified. If the PLI numbered lot is not
            reconditioned prior to the close of the business day, all PLI
            numbers must be obliterated. Any inspection certificate, numbered
            notesheet, or shipping clearance report issued upon a subsequent
            inspection, including when a lot is reconditioned, must be issued
            within four days of shipment of the potatoes.
