            corrective action; and, within 45 days of the review, conducts a
            follow-up on-site review to determine that the corrective action
            resolved the problems. Each on-site review shall ensure that the

             The State agency shall review each school food authority&apos;s
            Claim for Reimbursement, on a monthly basis, in an effort to ensure
            that monthly claims are limited to the number of free and reduced
            price lunches served, by type, to eligible children.

             The State agency shall, at a minimum, compare the number of free

            for free and reduced price lunches enrolled in the school food
            authority for the month of October times the days of operation times

            comparison against data which reflects the number of children
            approved for free and reduced price lunches for a more current
            month(s) as collected pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

            authority and the claim separates consolidated data for commodity
            schools from data for other schools. Unless otherwise approved by
            FNS, the Claim for Reimbursement for any month shall include only
            lunches and meal supplements served in that month except if the
            first or last month of Program operations for any school year
            contains 10 operating days or less, such month may be combined with
            the Claim for Reimbursement for the appropriate adjacent month.
            However, Claims for Reimbursement may not combine operations
            occurring in two fiscal years. If a single State agency administers

            and, if applicable, one reimbursable afterschool snack for each
            child every school day. If there are leftover meals, schools may
            offer them to the students but cannot get Federal reimbursement for
            them. Schools must identify, near or at the beginning of the serving
            line(s), the food items that constitute the unit-priced reimbursable
            school meal(s). The price of a reimbursable lunch does not change if

             Schools must offer meats/meat alternates daily as part of the lunch
            meal pattern. The quantity of meats/meat alternates must be the
            edible portion as served. This component must be served in a main
            dish or in a main dish and only one other food item. Schools without
            daily choices in this component should not serve any one meat
            alternate or form of meat (for example, ground, diced, pieces) more
            than three times in the same week. If a portion size of this
            component does not meet the daily requirement for a particular
            age/grade group, schools may supplement it with another meats/meat
            alternates to meet the full requirement. Schools may adjust the
            daily quantities of this component provided that a minimum of one
            ounce is offered daily to students in grades K-8 and a minimum of
            two ounces is offered daily to students in grades 9-12, and the
            total weekly requirement is met over a five-day period.

             The grains component is based on minimum daily servings plus total
            servings over a five-day school week. Beginning July 1, 2012 (SY
            2012-2013), half of the grains offered during the school week must
            meet the whole grain-rich criteria specified in FNS guidance.
            Beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015), all grains must meet the
            whole grain-rich criteria specified in FNS guidance. The whole
            grain-rich criteria provided in FNS guidance may be updated to
            reflect additional information provided voluntarily by industry on
            the food label or a whole grains definition by the Food and Drug
            Administration. Schools serving lunch 6 or 7 days per week must
            increase the weekly grains quantity by approximately 20 percent
            (1/5) for each additional day. When schools operate less than 5 days
            per week, they may decrease the weekly quantity by approximately 20
            percent (1/5) for each day less than five. The servings for
            biscuits, rolls, muffins, and other grain/bread varieties are
            specified in FNS guidance.

             If a school chooses to offer one or more substitutes for fluid milk
            for non-disabled students with medical or special dietary needs, the
            nondairy beverage(s) must provide the nutrients listed in the
            following table. Fluid milk substitutes must be fortified in
            accordance with fortification guidelines issued by the Food and Drug
            Administration. A school need only offer the nondairy beverage(s)
            that it has identified as allowable fluid milk substitutes according
            to the following chart.

             Schools may make substitutions for students without disabilities
            who cannot consume the regular lunch or afterschool snack because of
            medical or other special dietary needs. Substitutions must be made

            of the need for substitutions that includes recommended alternate
            foods, unless otherwise exempted by FNS. Except with respect to
            substitutions for fluid milk, such a statement must be signed by a
            recognized medical authority.

             To the extent that school food authorities identify foods in a

             Lunches served to infants ages birth through 11 months must meet
            the requirements in paragraph (k)(5) of this section. Foods included
            in the lunch must be of a texture and a consistency that are
            appropriate for the age of the infant being served. The foods must
            be served during a span of time consistent with the infant&apos;s
            eating habits. For those infants whose dietary needs are more
            individualized, exceptions to the meal pattern must be made in

             Infant lunches must include, at a minimum, each of the food
            components indicated in Lunch Pattern for Infants table in the
            amount that is appropriate for the infant&apos;s age. For some
            breastfed infants who regularly consume less than the minimum amount
            of breastmilk per feeding, a serving of less than the minimum amount
            of breastmilk may be offered. In these situations, additional
            breastmilk must be offered if the infant is still hungry. Lunches
            may include portions of breastmilk and iron-fortified infant formula
            as long as the total number of ounces meets, or exceeds, the minimum
            amount required of this food component. Similarly, to meet the
            component requirements for vegetables and fruits, portions of both
            may be served. Infant lunches are reimbursable when schools provide
            all of the components in the Lunch Pattern for Infants table that
            the infant is developmentally ready to accept.

            school year 2012-2013, State agencies may conduct the administrative
            reviews in school year 2012-13 or 2013-14; except that, State
            agencies must conduct reviews of those school food authorities
            identified as at-risk school food authorities in school year
            2012-2013.

            lunches, reduced price lunches, and paid lunches, respectively, who

            lunches for the same period times the operating days in that period.
            A similar computation is used to determine the reduced price and
            paid participation factors. The number of children approved for paid
            lunches is derived by subtracting the number of children approved
            for free and reduced price lunches for any given period from the
            total number of children enrolled in the reviewed school for the

            (for any school reviewed) are claimed incorrectly due to errors of

            authority&apos;s Superintendent (or equivalent in a non-public

            action, and the potential fiscal action. As a part of the denial of

             Each State agency shall provide FNS with full opportunity to
            conduct management evaluations of all State agency Program
            operations and shall provide OIG with full opportunity to conduct
            audits of all State agency Program operations. Each State agency
            shall make available its records, including records of the receipt
            and disbursement of funds under the Program and records of any claim
            compromised in accordance with this paragraph, upon a reasonable
            request by FNS, OIG, or the Comptroller General of the United
            States. FNS and OIG retain the right to visit schools and OIG also
            has the right to make audits of the records and operations of any
            school. In conducting management evaluations, reviews, or audits in
            a fiscal year, the State agency, FNS, or OIG may disregard an
            overpayment if the overpayment does not exceed $600. A State agency
            may establish, through State law, regulation or procedure, an
            alternate disregard threshold that does not exceed $600. This
            disregard may be made once per each management evaluation, review,
            or audit per Program within a fiscal year. However, no overpayment
            is to be disregarded where there is substantial evidence of
            violations of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.
