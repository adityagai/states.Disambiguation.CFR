            corporate handlers, who are present at such nomination meetings, may
            participate in the nomination and election of nominees for handler
            members and their alternates. Each handler shall be entitled to cast
            only one vote for each nominee to be elected in the district in

            year. If qualified, a person may vote either as a grower or as a
            handler but not as both.

             Any handler (including a grower-handler packing and handling
            apricots of his own production), whose packing facilities are
            located in an area where a Washington State Horticultural Division
            Inspection Office or Federal-State Inspector is not readily
            available to perform the required inspection may, prior to shipment,
            apply to the Committee for a permit authorizing a waiver of
            inspection. Applications shall be made on forms furnished by the
            Committee and shall contain such information as the Committee may
            require including: Name and address of applicant, location of
            packing facility, distance of packing facility from the nearest
            inspection office, period (by approximate beginning and ending
            dates) during which applicant expects to ship apricots, estimated
            quantity of apricots applicant expects to ship to fresh market
            during such period, manner in which the majority of applicant&apos;s
            fruit will be marketed (i.e., transported by applicant to market,
            sold at orchard to truckers, etc.), areas or markets to which
            applicant expects to ship the majority of his apricots. The
            application shall also contain an agreement by applicant (1) not to
            ship or handle any apricots unless such apricots meet the grade,
            size, maturity, container, and all other requirements of the amended
            marketing agreement and order in effect at time of handling, (2) to
            report periodically to the Committee on reporting forms furnished by
            the Committee the following information on each shipment: quantity,
            variety, grade, minimum size, container, date of shipment,
            destination, name and address of buyer or receiver, and such other
            information as the Committee may specify, (3) to pay applicable
            assessments on each shipment, (4) to have or cause to have each
            shipment of apricots inspected when such shipment is transported to
            a market or through a location en route to market where an inspector
            is available, 
            <PRTPAGE P='149' />
            and (5) to comply with such other safeguards as the Committee may
            prescribe.
