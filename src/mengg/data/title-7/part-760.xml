            any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment
            limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities
            with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such
            interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation
            because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a
            combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be
            reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the
            interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if
            anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or
            sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow
            a participant to directly receive a payment under this part, then
            the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with
            that interest. For all purposes under this section, unless otherwise
            specified in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-PART'>

            , the AGI figure that will be relevant for a person or legal entity
            will be an average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the
            most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by
            CCC.

            determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited

             For honeybee colony or honeybee hive losses to be considered
            eligible, the honeybee colony or honeybee hive producer must have
            incurred the loss in the county where the eligible adverse weather
            or eligible loss condition occurred. The honeybee colony or honeybee
            hive losses must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible
            loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator,
            including, but not limited to, earthquake, excessive wind, flood,
            hurricane, tornado, volcanic eruption, and wildfire. To be eligible
            for a loss of honeybees due to colony collapse disorder, the
            eligible honeybee producer must provide acceptable documentation to
            support that the loss was due to colony collapse disorder. Except
            for 2008 and 2009 honeybee losses, acceptable documentation must
            include an acceptable colony collapse disorder certification by an
            independent third party as determined by the Deputy Administrator,
            plus any other documentation requested by FSA. For 2008 and 2009
            honeybee losses such an independent certification is not required in
            all cases, but rather a self-certification by the honeybee producer
            as determined acceptable by the Deputy Administrator may be allowed
            in addition to whatever other documentation might be requested.

             For a death loss for bait fish or game fish to be considered
            eligible, the producer must have incurred the loss in the county
            where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition
            occurred. The bait fish or game fish death must be due to an
            eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition as determined by
            the Deputy Administrator including, but not limited to, an
            earthquake, flood, hurricane, tidal surge, tornado, and volcanic

             For the loss of honeybee colonies due to colony collapse disorder,
            the participant must also provide acceptable documentation or
            certification that the loss of the honeybee colony was due to colony
            collapse disorder. Except for 2008 and 2009 honeybee colony losses,
            acceptable documentation must include an independent third party
            certification determined acceptable by the Deputy Administrator,
            plus such additional information and documentation as may be
            requested. For 2008 and 2009 honeybee colony losses a
            self-certification may be accepted by FSA together with any
            additional information demanded by FSA as determined appropriate by
            the Deputy Administrator.

          By law, “up to” $50 million per year for the years in question may be
          approved for use by the Secretary and accordingly, within that cap,
          the only funds that will be considered available to pay claims will be
          that amount approved by the Secretary. Nothing in these regulations
          will limit the ability of the Secretary to restrict the availability
          of funds for the program as permitted by the relevant legislation.
          Payments will not be made for claims arising out of a particular year
          until, for all claims for that year, the time for applying for a
          payment has passed. In the event that, within the limits of the
          funding made available by the Secretary within the statutory cap,
          approval of eligible applications would result in expenditures in
          excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate the available funds
          by a national factor to reduce the total expected payments to the
          amount made available by the Secretary. FSA will make payments based
          on the factor for the national rate determined by FSA. FSA will
          prorate the payments in such manner as it determines appropriate and
          reasonable. Claims that are unpaid or prorated for a calendar year for
          any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds
          for later years or otherwise, but will be considered, as to any unpaid
          amount, void and nonpayable.

             An eligible livestock producer does not include any owner, cash or
            share lessee, or contract grower of livestock that rents or leases
            pastureland or grazing land owned by another person on a
            rate-of-gain basis. (That is, where the lease or rental agreement
            calls for payment based in whole or in part on the amount of weight
            gained by the animals that use the pastureland or grazing land.)

             equal to one, two, or three times the monthly payment rate
            specified in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section. Total LFP
            payments to an eligible livestock producer in a calendar year for
            grazing losses due to qualifying drought will not exceed three
            monthly payments for the same livestock. Payments calculated in this
            section or elsewhere with respect to LFP are subject to the
            adjustments and limits provided for in this part and are also
            subject to the payment limitations and average adjusted gross income
            provisions that are contained in subpart B. Payment may only be made
            to the extent that eligibility is specifically provided for in this
            subpart. Hence, with respect to drought, payments will be made only
            as a “one month” payment, a “two month” payment, or a “three month”
            payment based on the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of
            this section.

             Under this subpart, separate payment rates for eligible livestock
            owners and eligible livestock contract growers are specified in
            paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Payments for
            LIP are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each
            livestock category by the number of eligible livestock in excess of
            normal mortality in each category that died as a result of an
            eligible adverse weather event. Normal mortality for each livestock
            category will be determined by FSA on a State-by-State basis using
            local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock
            organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State.
            Adjustments will be applied as specified in paragraph (d) of this
            section.

             When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be different

            eligible for payment if the new types have the same general end use,
            as determined and approved by the county committee. Payments for
            alternative types will be based on the lesser of rates established
            to plant the types actually lost or the cost to establish the
            alternative used. If the type of plantings, seedlings, or cuttings
            differs significantly from the types lost, the costs may not be
            approved for payment.

             If a practice, such as site preparation, is needed to both replant
            and rehabilitate trees, bushes, or vines, the producer must document
            the expenses attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation. The
            county committee will determine whether the documentation of
            expenses detailing the amounts attributable to replanting versus
            rehabilitation is acceptable. In the event that the county committee
            determines the documentation does not include acceptable detail of
            cost allocation, the county committee will pro-rate payment based on
            physical inspection of the loss, damage, replanting, and

            participants with information regarding their interests in a farm,

            canceled, those acres will no longer be considered the initial crop
            and will, therefore, no longer be eligible for SURE.

            , if a farm has a crop that has both FSA and RMA acreage for insured
            crops, payment acres for the SURE guarantee calculation will 
            <PRTPAGE P='124' />
            be based on acres for which an indemnity was received if RMA acres
            do not differ from FSA acres by more than the larger of 5 percent or
            10 acres not to exceed 50 acres. If the difference between FSA and
            RMA acres is more than the larger of 5 percent or 10 acres not to
            exceed 50 acres, then the payment acres for the SURE guarantee will
            be calculated using RMA acres. In that case, the participant will be
            notified of the discrepancy and that refunds of unearned payments
            may be required after FSA and RMA reconcile acreage data.

             The participant must supply verifiable or reliable production
            records to substantiate production to the FSA county committee. If
            the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through
            commercial channels, acceptable production records include:
            Commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets or
            load summaries; or appraisal information from a loss adjuster
            acceptable to FSA. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed
            to livestock, or disposed of by means other than commercial
            channels, acceptable production records for these purposes include:
            Truck scale tickets; appraisal information from a

            loss adjuster acceptable to FSA; contemporaneous reliable diaries;
            or other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous reliable
            measurements. Determinations of reliability with respect to this

            agency to verify the evidence as well as the similarity of the
            evidence to reports or data received by FSA for the crop or similar
            crops. Other factors deemed relevant may also be taken into account.

             Producers applying for CAP must certify that they have an eligible
            ownership share interest in the 2009 crop acreage that sustained a
            five percent or greater loss. The determination and certification by
            a producer that a crop suffered the requisite five percent or
            greater farm crop loss is the expected quantity of production of the
            crop less the actual production of the crop.

             In the event that the producer does not submit documentation in
            response to any request of FSA to support the producer&apos;s
            application or documentation furnished does not show a crop loss of
            at least five percent as claimed, the application for that crop will
            be disapproved in its entirety. For quantity losses, producers need
            to apply a standard similar to the historic yield provisions used
            under previous ad hoc disaster programs. Those provisions provided
            that a historic yield was the higher of a county average yield or a
            producer&apos;s approved yield. Thus, if an applicant is determining
            whether a farm has a crop that suffered a loss of five percent or
            greater on the farm&apos;s planted and considered planted acreage,
            the applicant could compare the amount successfully produced in 2009
            from those planted and considered planted acres to what the
            participant expected to produce from that acreage using either the
            county average yield (which may be obtained from FSA by request) or
            based on analysis of approved actual production history yields that
            may exist for producers of the crop on the farm.

            application overstates the loss level of the crop when the actual

            claimed, or where the CAP payment would exceed the producer&apos;s
            actual loss, the application will be disapproved for the crop and

            with interest from date of disbursement. The CAP payment cannot

            will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a
            payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal
            entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal
            entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or
            their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment
            to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of
            the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the

            entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that

          This part sets forth the terms and conditions for the 2005-2007 Crop
          Disaster Program (2005-2007 CDP). CDP makes emergency financial
          assistance available to producers who have incurred crop losses in
          quantity or quality for eligible 2005, 2006, or 2007 crop years due to
          disasters as determined by the Secretary under provisions of Title IX
          of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans&apos; Care, Katrina Recovery,
          and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (
          <aref target='_blank' title='Pub. L. 110-28' alt='Pub. L. 110-28' href='http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ28/html/PLAW-110publ28.htm'>

          ). However, to be eligible for assistance, the crop subject to the
          loss must have been planted or existed before February 28, 2007, or,
          in the case of prevented planting, would have been planted before
          February 28, 2007.

             County committees have the authority to require a participant to
            provide necessary documentation, which may include, but is not
            limited to, previous marketing contracts fulfilled, to substantiate
            and validate quality standards in paragraph (b)(9) of this section
            and marketing contract price received for the commodity for which
            crop quality loss assistance is requested. In cases where the county
            committee has reason to believe the participant lacks the capacity
            or history to fulfill the quality provisions of the marketing
            contract the county committee will require such documentation.

             Preliminary, unadjusted LCP payments are calculated for a producer
            by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock
            category, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, by the
            number of eligible livestock for the producer in each category. The
            national payment rate represents the cost of the amount of corn
            needed to maintain the specific livestock for 30 days, as determined
            by FSA. As provided in subpart K of this part, a producer may
            receive benefits for only one of the three program years, 2005,
            2006, or 2007. The producer must indicate which year has been
            chosen. Payments are available only with respect to disaster-related
            fees losses in the period from January 2, 2005 through February 27,
            2007, in eligible counties for losses during the times specified for
            the disaster periods as specified in

          FSA will administer a limited 2005-2007 CGP to provide assistance to
          catfish producers in eligible counties that suffered catfish feed and
          related losses between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2007, that is
          after January 1, 2005, and before February 28, 2007. Under the
          2005-2007 CGP, FSA will provide grants to State governments in those
          States that have catfish producers that are located in eligible
          counties and that have agreed to participate in the 2005-2007 CGP. The
          amount of each grant will be based on the total value of catfish feed
          and related losses suffered in eligible counties in the subject state.
          Each State must submit a work plan providing a summary of how the
          State will implement the 2005-2007 CGP.

             Producers must be paid for feed losses of higher costs only for one
            of the three years, 2005, 2006, or 2007, and the loss must be for

            pursuant to subpart K of this part. Further, the feed loss or higher
            costs must be caused by the disaster that caused the county to
            qualify as an eligible county. The loss, moreover, to qualify for
            payment, must have occurred during the allowable time period
            provided in this part, namely the period beginning on January 2,

             To be eligible for payment, dairy producers marketing milk during
            February through July 2009 must provide any required supporting
            documents to assist FSA in verifying production. Supporting
            documentation may be provided by either the dairy producer or by the
            dairy operation for each of its producers. Examples of supporting
            documentation may include, but are not limited to: Milk marketing
            payment stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk
            marketings, copies of any payments received as compensation from
            other sources, or any other documents available to confirm the
            production and production history of the dairy operation. Dairy
            operations and producers may also be required to allow FSA to
            examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting
            documentation requested is not presented to FSA, the request for
            benefits will be denied.
