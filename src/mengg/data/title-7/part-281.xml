             These regulations govern the operation of the Food Stamp Program on
            Indian reservations either separately or concurrently with the Food
            distribution program. In order to assure that the Food Stamp Program
            is responsive to the needs of Indians on reservations, State
            agencies are required to consult with Indian tribal organizations
            about the implementation and operation of the Food Stamp Program on
            reservations. Also, under certain specified conditions Indian tribal
            organizations on reservations can administer the Food Stamp Program.
            The Act authorizes the Secretary to pay such amounts for
            administrative costs as are determined to be necessary for the
            effective operation of the Food Stamp Program on Indian
            reservations.

             The appropriate ITO of an established Indian reservation will
            qualify for participation under the provisions of this part, when
            that ITO files an application which demonstrates the status of an
            area as an established reservation, unless FNS determines that such
            area(s) does not qualify as a reservation, as that term is defined
            in these regulations. For purposes of this part, established
            reservation means the geographically defined area(s) currently
            recognized and established by Federal or State treaty or by Federal
            statute whereby such geographically defined area(s) is set aside for
            the use of Indians. Where such established areas exist, the
            appropriate ITO is presumed to exercise governmental jurisdiction,
            unless otherwise determined by FNS:

             FNS shall examine State agency adminstration of the Food Stamp
            Program on all or part of a reservation when requested by the ITO,
            the State agency or at FNS&apos; discretion. When FNS determines
            that a deficiency in a State agency operation of the Food Stamp
            Program on all or part of an Indian reservation may be serious
            enough to warrant a review, FNS shall advise the State agency and
            the ITO in writing of the alleged deficiencies and of its plans to
            conduct the review and document deficiencies, if any are found.
            Subsequent to October 1, 1979 FNS shall complete these reviews
            within 90 days from receipt of an ITO&apos;s or State agency&apos;s
            request except under unusual circumstances such as the receipt of a
            large number of simultaneous requests.

             The review shall be designed to determine whether or not the State
            agency is properly administering the Food Stamp Program on a
            specific reservation. When an agency of State government is
            administering the Program on a reservation, FNS shall as a part of
            the review consult with the ITO about the operation of the Program
            on the reservation. The review should, depending on the nature of
            the complaint, include but not be limited to, an analysis of some or
            all of the following data:
