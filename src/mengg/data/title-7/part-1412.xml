          This part governs: How base acres and farm program payment yields are
          established or adjusted for the purpose of calculating direct and
          counter-cyclical payments for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley,
          oats, upland cotton, rice, peanuts, soybeans, sunflower seed,
          rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe, sesame
          seed, pulse crops, and other designated oilseeds as determined and
          announced by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), for the years
          2008 through 2012; the month when producers on a farm may enter into
          annual Direct and Counter-cyclical Program (DCP) or Average Crop
          Revenue Election (ACRE) program contracts with CCC for each of the
          years 2008 through 2012, as applicable; and the peanut crop acreage
          bases and yields in order to receive 2008 through 2012 direct and
          counter-cyclical payments. Payments otherwise provided for in this
          part are subject to changes made by statute in rates, conditions, and
          eligibility notwithstanding any contract made under this part.
          However, any such modification may, as determined by the Deputy
          Administrator, allow producers the opportunity to withdraw from the
          contract. Also, if any refund comes due to CCC under this part,
          interest will be due from the date of the CCC disbursement except as
          determined by the Deputy Administrator. The provisions of this section
          will apply notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other
          part. In order to receive payment under this part a participant must
          comply with the regulations in this part and any additional
          requirements imposed by the program contract.

          example, for the 2009 program the relevant crop year is the 2009 crop

            ACRE plug yield

           means the resulting yield determined by taking the applicable NASS
          county average yield for the covered commodity or peanuts, by practice
          if applicable, and multiplying it by 95 percent. The ACRE plug yield
          may be used by a farm in establishing an initial benchmark farm yield
          or reporting actual production in accordance with instructions issued
          by the Deputy Administrator. The ACRE plug yield is also used on a
          farm for a covered commodity or peanuts in a year where there are no
          acres of the covered commodity or peanuts planted. The ACRE plug yield
          may be found on the FSA Web site at:

           by clicking “ACRE County Yields.” ACRE plug yields are used in
          benchmark farm yields. If the National Agricultural Statistical
          Service (NASS) data is not available for a particular practice of a
          covered commodity or peanuts from which an ACRE plug yield can be
          established, the Deputy Administrator may establish an ACRE plug yield
          for the practice of the covered commodity or peanuts based a
          computation of multiplying 95 percent times the yield determined based
          on production data available from FSA farm records in the county, or
          in the event sufficient records do not exist, another data source

            have submitted all applicable contracts and documentation necessary
            to make such approval, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.
            For those producers with an interest but a zero share of contract
            acreage, the contract will not be approved before all producers have
            signed the contract or furnished supportive and necessary
            contractual documents (such as cash leases in lieu of signing for a
            zero share). A contract not having all requisite signatures of

            according to this section will be deemed withdrawn and will not be
            approved. Producers on a farm are solely responsible for ensuring
            that enrollment occurs.

            harvest fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on the same acres in cycle
            with a covered commodity or peanuts planted and harvested for
            peanuts, grain, or lint in a 12-month period under normal growing
            conditions for the region and being able to repeat the same cycle in
            the following 12-month period. For purposes of this part, the

            history of double-cropping covered commodities or peanuts with
            fruits, vegetables, or wild rice. State committees have established

            , for each of the 2009 and subsequent crop years, the Planting
            Transferability Pilot Project (Project) will permit, in accordance
            with the limitations and provisions of this section only, the
            planting of certain crops in certain States on base acres without
            violating the DCP or ACRE contract. Base acres on 
            <PRTPAGE P='504' />
            farms participating in the Project will be reduced an acre (or
            portion thereof) for every acre (or portion thereof) planted in the
            Project, for the year in which the farm is participating in the
            Project.

             Producers interested in participating in the Project must first be
            enrolled in either a DCP or ACRE program contract and submit an
            offer for participation in the Project accompanied by a copy of the
            contract mentioned in paragraph (f) of this section no later than
            March 1 of the fiscal year in which participation in the Project is
            desired. At the conclusion of the signup period, CCC will determine
            if it received more offers than the acreage limitation paragraph (e)
            of this section allows. If the offers exceed the acreage limitation
            in the State, CCC will conduct a lottery style selection process and
            approve offers for participation in the Project that will ensure
            that the number of base acres eligible for each year under the
            Project are not exceeded. In the event that CCC cannot approve an
            offer in its entirety, at CCC&apos;s discretion, CCC may give the
            producers the opportunity to enroll less acres in the Project. CCC
            will also notify producers of the results of the selection process.
            Under no circumstances can producers challenge either the selection
            process itself or the results via administrative appeal. Producers
            in each of the States mentioned in this section can elect to
            participate in the Project with their offer as accepted by CCC, or,
            if CCC elects to offer approval of part of an offer, participate
            with their offer as reduced by CCC, or the producers can elect not
            to participate in the Project.

             Payments received under this subpart will be divided in the manner
            specified in the applicable contract or agreement and CCC will
            ensure that producers, who would have an interest in acreage being
            offered, receive treatment that CCC deems to be equitable, as
            determined by the Deputy Administrator. CCC may refuse to enter into
            a contract when there is a disagreement among persons seeking
            enrollment as to a person&apos;s eligibility to participate in the
            contract as a tenant and there is insufficient evidence to indicate
            whether the person seeking participation as a tenant does or does
            not have an interest in the acreage offered for enrollment in ACRE.

             In addition to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section,
            tenants must maintain their tenancy throughout the contract period
            in order to remain on a contract. Tenants who fail to maintain
            tenancy on the acreage under contract, including failure to comply
            with provisions under applicable State law, may be removed from a
            contract by CCC. CCC will assume the tenancy is being maintained
            unless notified otherwise by a ACRE participant specified in the
            applicable contract.
