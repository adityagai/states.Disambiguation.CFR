          1986, the Secretary may recognize an organization that represents not
          fewer than 50 producers who market annually an aggregate of not less
          than 10 percent of the pounds of porcine animals marketed in such
          State. The Secretary may cease to recognize a State association and
          instead recognize another organization of producers in a State as that
          State&apos;s association if the Secretary determines either that a
          majority of the members of the existing State association are not

            on that action. The Delegate Body shall give timely notice of its
            meetings. The Delegate Body shall give the Secretary the same notice

            Board shall give the Secretary the same notice of its meetings,
            including the meetings of its committees, as it gives to its members
            in order that the Secretary, or a representative of the Secretary,

            taken by this emergency procedure is valid only if all members are
            notified and provided the opportunity to vote and any telephone vote
            is confirmed promptly in writing and recorded in the Board minutes.

          due such person from the Board, such person shall be notified of the

        <P>
          Any assessment not paid when due shall be increased 1.5 percent each
          month beginning with the day following the date such assessment was
          due. Any remaining amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges
          previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at the
          same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until
          paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment that was
          determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of
          a person&apos;s failure to submit a report to the Board when due shall
          be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due
          if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness of a payment to
          the Board shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the date
          actually received by the Board, whichever is earlier.

             Counting the ballots. Under the supervision of FSA CED, acting on
            behalf of the Administrator, AMS, the in-person registration and
            certification form envelopes (Form LS-72-2) and the absentee “Pork
            Referendum” envelopes (Form LS-73-1) containing the “Pork Ballot”
            envelopes for producer voters will be checked against the In-Person
            Voter Registration List (Form LS-75) and the Absentee Voter Request
            List (Form LS-74), respectively, to determine properly registered
            voters. The ballots of producers voting in-person whose names are
            not on the In-Person Voter Registration List (Form LS-75), will be
            declared invalid. Likewise, the ballots of producers voting absentee
            whose names are not on the Absentee Voter Request List (Form LS-74)
            will be declared invalid. All ballots of challenged producer voters
            declared ineligible and invalid ballots will be kept separate from
            the other ballots and the envelopes containing these ballots will
            not be opened. The valid ballots will be counted on November 29,
            2000, during regular business hours on the 46th business day after
            the last day of the in-person voting period. FSA county office
            employees will remove the sealed “Pork Ballot” envelopes (Form
            LS-72-1) from the registration form envelopes and “Pork Referendum”
            envelopes (absentee voting) envelopes of all eligible producer
            voters and all challenged producer voters determined to be eligible.
            After removing all “Pork Ballot” envelopes, FSA county employees
            will shuffle the sealed “Pork Ballot” envelopes or otherwise mix
            them up so that ballots cannot be matched with producers&apos;
            names. After shuffling the “Pork Ballot” envelopes, FSA county
            employees will open them and count the ballots. The ballots will be
            counted as follows:
