          Voluntary conveyance of real property by the borrower to the

        <P>
          Voluntary conveyance is a method of liquidation by which title to
          security is transferred to the Government. FmHA or its successor
          agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>
            Public Law 103-354

           will not make a demand on a borrower to voluntarily convey. If there
          is equity in the property. FmHA or its successor agency under

           should advise the borrower, in writing, that there is equity in the
          property before accepting an offer to voluntarily convey. If FmHA or
          its successor agency under

           receives an offer of voluntary conveyance, acceptance should only be
          considered when the Government will likely receive a recovery on its
          investment. In cases where there are outstanding liens, a full
          assessment should be made of the debts against the property compared
          to the current market value. FmHA or its successor agency under

          agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

          of this chapter; all available servicing actions outlined in the

          In determining if the acceptance of the FP voluntary conveyance is in
          the best financial interest of the Government, the County Supervisor
          will determine if the borrower has exhausted all possibilities of
          restructuring the loan to where a feasible plan of operation may be
          developed, the borrower has acted in good faith in trying to service
          the debt and FmHA or its successor agency under

          , a voluntary conveyance should only be accepted when it is determined
          to be in the Government&apos;s best financial interest. Rejection of
          an offer of voluntary conveyance made before or after acceleration
          from an FP borrower is appealable. For borrowers having both FP and
          non-FP loans secured by a farm tract, a voluntary conveyance should be
          handled as outlined above for non-FP loans secured by farm tracts,
          except that the applicable servicing option for the FP and non-FP
          loans should be considered separately. This separation of servicing
          options may permit a borrower to retain the nonfarm tract. For newly

          When the Government did not protect its interest in security property
          in a foreclosure by another lienholder, and if the Government has
          redemption rights, the State Director will determine whether to redeem
          the property. This determination will be based on all pertinent
          factors including the value of the property after the sale, and costs
          which may be incurred in acquiring and reselling the property. For
          Farmer Program loans, the County Supervisor will document the
          determination on exhibit G of this subpart. The decision must be made
          far enough in advance of expiration of the redemption period to permit
          exercise of the Government&apos;s rights. If the property is to be
          redeemed, complete information documenting the basis for not acquiring
          the property at the sale and factors which justify redemption of the
          property will be included in the case file. The assistance of OGC will
          be obtained in effecting the redemption. If the State Director decides
          not to redeem the property, the Government&apos;s right of redemption
          under Federal law (
          <aref type='USC'>

          redemption exists and may be sold, it will not be disposed of for less
          than its value.

            extension of time to accomplish voluntary liquidation or a written
            proposal to cure the default(s). The receipt of a payment with no
            proposal to cure the defaults is not considered a viable offer, and
            such payments will be returned to the borrower. The approval

          requirement or provision of this subpart or address any omission of
          this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or

          endangered if there is no adverse effect on the Government&apos;s
          interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority upon the
          request of the State Director with recommendation of the appropriate
          program Assistant Administrator; or upon request initiated by the
          appropriate program Assistant Administrator. Requests for exceptions
          must be made in writing and supported with documentation to explain
          the adverse effect, propose alternative courses of action, and show

            property, the servicing official shall make a diligent attempt to
            locate the borrower to determine what the borrower&apos;s intentions
            are concerning the property. This includes making inquiries of
            neighbors, checking with the Postal Service, utility companies,
            employer(s), if known, and schools, if the borrower has children, to
            see if the borrower&apos;s whereabouts can be determined and an
            address obtained. A State supplement may be issued if necessary to
            further define “abandonment” based on State law. If the borrower is
            not occupying or is not in possession of the property but has it
            listed for sale with a real estate broker or has made other
            arrangements for its care or sale, it will not be considered
            abandoned so long as it is adequately secured and maintained. Except
            for borrowers with Farmers Program loans, if the borrower has made
            no effort to sell the property and can be located, an opportunity to
            voluntarily convey the property to the Government will be offered
            the borrower in accordance with

          If inventory property is subject to redemption rights, the State
          Director, with prior approval of OGC, will issue a State Supplement
          giving guidance concerning the former borrower&apos;s rights, whether
          or not the property may be leased or sold by the Government, payment
          of taxes, maintenance, and any other items OGC deems necessary to
          comply with State laws. Routine care and maintenance will be provided

          Advice and assistance will be obtained from OGC where eviction from
          realty or dispossession of chattel property is necessary. Where OGC
          has given written authorization, eviction may be effected through
          State courts rather than Federal courts when the former borrower is
          involved, or through local courts instead of Federal/State courts when

             To the maximum extent practicable, the Agency will maximize the

             Property which secured housing loans will be classified as
            “program” or “nonprogram (NP).” After a determination of whether the
            property is suited for retention in the respective program, the
            repair policy outlined in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 1955.64(a) of
            </aref>
             this subpart will be followed. In determining whether a property is
            suited for retention in the program, items such as size, design,
            possible health and/or safety hazards and obsolescence due to
            functional, economic, or locational conditions must carefully be
            considered. Generally, program property will meet, or can be
            realistically repaired to meet, the standards for existing housing
            outlined in Subpart A of 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-PART'>

             provided the property is typical of modest homes in the area. The
            cost of repairs will generally not be considered in determining
            suitability. Since houses, sites and locations vary widely
            throughout the country, discretion and sound judgment must be used
            in determining suitability. The majority of houses RHS acquires will
            be suited for retention and classified as program property. In some
            instances, property will not be suited for retention in the program
            and will be classified as “nonprogram (NP)” property. Situations of
            this type include, but are not limited to:

             Management methods and requirements will vary depending on such

            location, and market conditions. Management tools which may be used
            effectively range from contracts to secure individual property, have
            the grass cut, or winterize a dwelling; a simple management contract
            to provide maintenance and other services on a group of properties
            (including but not limited to specification writing, inspection of
            repairs, and yard and directional signs and their installation), or
            manage an MFH project; blanket-purchase arrangement contracts to
            obtain services for more than one property; to a broad-scope
            management contract with a real estate broker or management agent
            which may include inspection and specification-writing services,
            making simple repairs, obtaining lessees, collecting rents,
            coordination with listing brokers in marketing the properties and
            effecting eviction of tenants when necessary. A contractor may
            handle evictions only where State laws permit the contractor to do
            so in his/her own name; a contractor may not pursue eviction in the
            name of the Government (FmHA or its successor agency under

             this subpart. Farm or organization property, such as rental housing
            and community facilities, may be operated under a management
            contract if the State Director has determined it is approporiate to
            have the property in operation. In any case, the primary

            or leased under a management contract is located in an area
            identified by the Federal Insurance Administration as a special
            flood or mudslide hazard area, lessees or tenants must be notified

          When inventory real property, except for FSA and MFH properties,
          cannot be sold promptly, or when custodial property is subject to
          lengthy liquidation proceedings, leasing may be used as a management
          tool when it is clearly in the best interest of the Government.
          Leasing will not be used as a means of deferring other actions which
          should be taken, such as liquidation of loans in abandonment cases or
          repair and sale of inventory property. Leases will provide for
          cancellation by the lessee or the Agency on 30-day written notice
          unless Special Stipulations in an individual lease for good reason
          provide otherwise. If extensive repairs are needed to render a
          custodial property suitable for occupancy, this will preclude its
          being leased since repairs must be limited to those essential to
          prevent further deterioration of the security in accordance with

             To arrive at a market rent amount, the county official will make a
            survey of lease amounts of farms in the immediate area with similar
            soils, capabilities, and income potential. The income-producing
            capability of the property during the term of the lease must also be
            considered. This rental data will be maintained in an operational
            file as well as in the running records of case files for leased
            inventory properties. While cash rent is preferred, the lease of a
            farm on a crop-share basis may be approved if this is the customary
            method in the area. The lessee will market the crops, provide FSA
            with documented evidence of crop income, and pay the pro rata share
            of the income to FSA.

             farm inventory properties will have a detrimental effect on the
            value of farms within these areas. Such analysis will be carried out
            in January of each year and as often throughout the year as
            necessary to reflect changing farm real estate conditions. If the
            analyses of farm real estate conditions indicate that such sales
            would put downward pressure on farm real estate values in any area,
            all farm properties within the area affected will be withheld from
            the market and managed in accordance with the provisions of Subpart
            B of this Part until such time that a subsequent analysis indicates
            otherwise. The State Director will notify, in writing, the County
            Supervisor(s) servicing those areas that are restricted from selling
            farm inventory property. State Directors in consultation with other
            lenders, real estate agents, auctioneers, and others in the

             Not later than 15 days from the date of acquisition, the Agency
            will advertise suitable property for sale. For properties currently

             subpart B of this part, the property will be advertised for sale
            not later than 60 days after the lease expires or is terminated.
            There will be a preference for beginning farmers or ranchers. The
            advertisement will contain a provision to lease the property to a
            beginning farmer or rancher for up to 18 months should FSA credit
            assistance not be available at the time of sale. The first
            advertisement will not be required to contain the sales price but it
            should inform potential beginning farmer or rancher applicants that
            applications will be accepted pending completion of the
            advertisement process. When possible, the sale of suitable FSA
            property should be handled by county officials. Farm property will
            be advertised for sale by publishing, as a minimum, two weekly
            advertisements in at least two newspapers that are widely circulated
            in the area in which the farm is located. Consideration will be
            given to advertising inventory properties in major farm
            publications. Either Form RD 1955-40 or Form RD 1955-41, “Notice of
            Sale,” will be posted in a prominent place in the county. Maximum
            publicity should be given to the sale under guidance provided by

             The county official will first determine whether applicants meet

            applicants who are not determined to be beginning farmers or
            ranchers, they may request that the State Executive Director provide
            an expedited review and determination of whether the applicant is a
            beginning farmer or rancher for the purpose of acquiring inventory
            property. This review shall take 
            <PRTPAGE P='126' />
            place not later than 30 days after denial of the application. The
            State Executive Director&apos;s review decision shall be final and
            is not administratively appealable. When there is more than one
            beginning farmer or rancher applicant, the Agency will select by lot
            by placing the names in a receptacle and drawing names sequentially.
            Drawn offers will be numbered and those drawn after the first drawn
            name will be held in suspense pending sale to the successful
            applicant. The random selection drawing will be open to the public,

             SFH property will be appraised at any time additional market data
            indicates this action is warranted. If SFH inventory has not sold
            after being actively marketed, the price will be administratively
            reduced. An administrative price reduction will be made without
            changing the SFH appraisal. For ease in computing dates for
            administrative price reductions, each month is assumed to have
            thirty days. The following schedule of administrative price
            reductions will be followed:

             For multiple-family property, the sale price will only be reduced
            to the extent that the market value has decreased as shown in a
            current market appraisal. The District Director will not reduce the
            price without the prior written approval of the State Director. The
            State Director must request National Office authorization on
            reductions in price for multiple-family property if the inventory
            value at the time of acquisition exceeded the State Director&apos;s
            loan approval authority.

            years. If the State Director determines more favorable terms are
            necessary to facilitate the sale, the note amount may be amortized
            using a 30-year factor with payment in full (balloon payment) due
            not later than 10 years from the date of closing. In no case will
            the term be longer than the period for which the property will serve
            as adequate security.

             this subpart provides detailed guidance on sealed bid sales
            applicable to the sale of chattels. When it is believed that
            financing will have to be provided through a credit sale, this
            method has advantages over auction sales. It requires, however,
            additional steps in the event any established minimum price is not
            obtained. Preference will be given to a cash offer which is at least
            __* percent of the highest offer requiring credit.

             The servicing official may request authorization from the State
            Director to pay fixed amount bonuses for special effort property,
            such as a property with a value so low that the commission alone
            does not warrant broker interest or property that has been held in
            inventory for an extended period of time where it is believed that
            an added bonus will create additional efforts by the broker to sell
            the property. The State Director may authorize use of short-term
            (not to exceed three months) special effort sales bonuses on a
            group, county, district or state-wide basis, if it appears necessary
            to facilitate the sale of nonprogram property.

            has passed to the purchaser. No commission will be paid where the

             approval official has reason to believe that conveyance would
            result in a change in use of the real property. For example,
            farmland would be converted to a nonfarm use; or an industrial
            facility would be changed to a different industrial use that would
            produce increased gaseous, liquid or solid wastes over the former
            use or changes in the type or contents of such wastes. Assessments
            are not required for conveyance where the real property would be
            retained in its former use within the reasonably foreseeable future.

             Executive Order 11988, “Floodplain Management,” and Executive Order
            11990, “Protection of Wetlands,” require the conveyance instrument
            for inventory property containing floodplains or wetlands which is
            proposed for lease or sale to specify those uses that are restricted
            under identified Federal, State and local floodplains or wetlands
            regulations as well as other appropriate restrictions. The
            restrictions shall be to the uses of the property by the lessee or
            purchaser and any successors, except where prohibited by law.
            Applicable restrictions will be incorporated into quitclaim deeds in
            a format similar to that contained in Exhibits H and I of RD
            Instruction 1955-C (available in any Agency office). A listing of
            all restrictions will be included in the notices required in

           inventory property, except suitable FP real property which will not
          be sold by sealed bid. Before a sealed bid sale, the State Director
          will determine and document the minimum sale price acceptable. In
          determining a minimum sale price, the State Director will consider the
          length of time the property has been in inventory, previous marketing
          efforts, the type property involved, and potential purchasers. Program
          financing will be offered on sales of program and suitable property.
          For NP or surplus property, credit may be extended to facilitate the
          sale. When a group of properties is to be sold at one time,
          advertising may indicate that FmHA or its successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

        <P>
          This section provides guidance on the sale of all inventory property
          by auction, except FSA real property. Before an auction, the State
          Director, with the advice of the National Office for organizational
          property, will determine and document the minimum sale price
          acceptable. In determining a minimum sale price, the State Director
          will consider the length of time the property has been in inventory,
          previous marketing efforts, the type property involved, and potential
          purchasers. Program financing will be offered on sales of program and
          property. For NP property, credit may be offered to facilitate the
          sale. Credit, however, may not exceed the market value of the property
          nor may the term exceed the period for which the property will serve
          as adequate security. For program property sales, no preference will
          be given to program purchasers. The State Director will also consider
          whether an Agency employee will conduct an auction or whether the
          services of a professional 
          <PRTPAGE P='157' />
          auctioneer are necessary due to the complexity of the sale. When the
          services of a professional auctioneer are advisable, the services will
          be procured by contract in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A
          (available in any Agency Office). Chattel property may be sold at
          public auction that is widely advertised and held on a regularly
          scheduled basis without solicitation. Form RD 1955-46 will be used for
          auction sales. At the auction, successful bidders will be required to
          make a bid deposit. For program and suitable property, the bid deposit
          will be the same as outlined in 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            § 1955.130(e)(1) of
          </aref>
           this subpart. For NP property sales, a bid deposit of 10 percent is
          required. Deposits will be in the form of cashier&apos;s check,
          certified check, postal or bank money order or bank draft payable to
          the Agency, cash or personal checks may be accepted when deemed
          necessary for a successful auction by the person conducting the
          auction. Where credit sales are authorized, all notices and publicity
          should provide for a method of prior approval of credit and the credit
          limit for potential purchasers. This may include submission of letters
          of credit or financial statements prior to the auction. The auctioneer
          should not accept a bid which requests credit in excess of the market
          value. When the highest bid is lower than the minimum amount
          acceptable to the Agency, negotiations should be conducted with the
          highest bidder or in turn, the next highest bidder or other persons to
          obtain an executed bid at the predetermined minimum.
