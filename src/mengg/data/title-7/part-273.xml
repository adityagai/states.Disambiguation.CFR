            otherwise eligible member of a household who is 60 years of age or
            older and is unable to purchase and prepare meals because he or she
            suffers from a disability considered permanent under the Social
            Security Act or a non disease-related, severe, permanent disability
            may be considered, together with his or her spouse (if living
            there), a separate household from the others with whom the
            individual lives. Separate household status under this provision
            must not be granted when the income of the others with whom the
            elderly disabled individual resides (excluding the income of the
            elderly and disabled individual and his or her spouse) exceeds 165
            percent of the poverty line.

             Residents of a commercial boarding house, regardless of the number
            of residents, are not eligible to participate in the Program. A
            commercial boarding house is an establishment licensed to offer
            meals and lodging for compensation. It does not include any of the
            entities listed in paragraph (b)(7)(vii) of this section. In project
            areas without licensing requirements, a commercial boarding house is
            a commercial establishment that offers meals and lodging for
            compensation with the intent of making a profit.

             A State agency shall not use the head of household designation to
            impose special requirements on the household, such as requiring that
            the head of household, rather than another responsible member of the
            household, appear at the certification office to make application
            for benefits. When designating the head of household, the State
            agency shall allow the household to select an adult parent of
            children (of any age) living in the household, or an adult who has
            parental control over children (under 18 years of age) living in the
            household, as the head of household provided that all adult
            household members agree to the selection. The State agency shall
            permit such households to select their head at each certification
            action or whenever there is a change in household composition. The
            State agency shall provide written notice to all households at the
            time of application and as otherwise appropriate that specifies the
            household&apos;s right to select its head of household in accordance
            with this paragraph. The written notice shall identify which
            households have the option to select their head of household, the
            circumstances under which a household may change its designation of
            head of household, and how such changes must be reported to the
            State agency. If all adult household members do not agree to the
            selection or decline to select an adult parent as the head of
            household, the State agency may designate the head of household or
            permit the household to make another selection. In no event shall
            the household&apos;s failure to select an adult parent of children
            or an adult who has parental control over children as the head of
            household delay the certification or result in the denial of
            benefits of an otherwise eligible household. For households that do
            not consist of 
            <PRTPAGE P='716' />
            adult parents and children or adults who have parental control of
            children living in the household, the State agency shall designate
            the head of household or permit the household to do so.

            the head of the household at the time of the violation, shall be

             State agencies must establish procedures governing the operation of
            food stamp offices that the State agency determines best serve
            households in the State, including households with special needs,
            such as, but not limited to, households with elderly or disabled
            members, households in rural areas 
            <PRTPAGE P='717' />
            with low-income members, homeless individuals, households residing
            on reservations, households with adult members who are not
            proficient in English, and households with earned income (working
            households). The State agency must provide timely, accurate, and
            fair service to applicants for, and participants in, the Food Stamp
            Program. The State agency cannot, as a condition of eligibility,
            impose additional application or application processing
            requirements. The State agency must have a procedure for informing
            persons who wish to apply for food stamps about the application
            process and their rights and responsibilities. The State agency must
            base food stamp eligibility solely on the criteria contained in the
            Act and this part.

             The application process includes filing and completing an
            application form, being interviewed, and having certain information
            verified. The State agency must act promptly on all applications and
            provide food stamp benefits retroactive to the month of application
            to those households that have completed the application process and
            have been determined eligible. The State agency must make expedited
            service available to households in immediate need. Specific
            responsibilities of households and State agencies in the application
            process are detailed below.

             If a State agency has a procedure that allows applicants to apply
            for the food stamp program and another program at the same time, the
            State agency shall notify applicants that they may file a joint
            application for more than one program or they may file a separate
            application for food stamps independent of their application for
            benefits from any other program. All food stamp applications,
            regardless of whether they are joint applications or separate
            applications, must be processed for food stamp purposes in
            accordance with food stamp procedural, timeliness, notice, and fair
            hearing requirements. No household shall have its food stamp
            benefits denied solely on the basis that its application to
            participate in another program has been denied or its benefits under
            another program have been terminated without a separate
            determination by the State agency that the household failed to
            satisfy a food stamp eligibility requirement. Households that file a
            joint application for food stamps and another program and are denied
            benefits for the other program shall not be required to resubmit the
            joint application or to file another application for food stamps but
            shall have its food stamp eligibility determined based on the joint
            application in accordance with the food stamp processing time frames
            from the date the joint application was initially accepted by the
            State agency.

             Households must file food stamp applications by submitting the
            forms to the food stamp office either in person, through an
            authorized representative, by fax or other electronic transmission,
            by mail, or by completing an on-line electronic application. The
            State agency must provide households that complete an on-line
            electronic application in person at the food stamp office the
            opportunity to review the information that has been 
            <PRTPAGE P='719' />
            recorded electronically and must provide them with a copy of that
            information for their records. Applications signed through the use
            of electronic signature techniques or applications containing a
            handwritten signature and then transmitted by fax or other
            electronic transmission are acceptable. State agencies must document
            the date the application was filed by recording the date of receipt
            at the food stamp office. When a resident of an institution is
            jointly applying for SSI and food stamps prior to leaving the
            institution, the filing date of the application that the State
            agency must record is the date of release of the applicant from the
            institution. The length of time a State agency has to deliver
            benefits is calculated from the date the application is filed in the
            food stamp office designated by the State agency to accept the
            household&apos;s application, except when a resident of a public
            institution is jointly applying for SSI and food stamps prior to
            his/her release from an institution in accordance with

            application form on the same day it contacts the food stamp office
            during office hours. The household shall be advised that it does not
            have to be interviewed before filing the application and may file an
            incomplete application form as long as the form contains the
            applicant&apos;s name and address, and is signed by a responsible
            member of the household or the household&apos;s authorized
            representative. State agencies shall document the date the
            application was filed by recording on the application the date it
            was received by the food stamp office. When a resident of an
            institution is jointly applying for SSI and food stamps prior to
            leaving the institution, the filing date of the application to be
            recorded by the State agency on the food stamp application is the
            date of release of the applicant from the institution.

            that the disadvantages and requirements of applying for cash
            assistance do not apply to food stamps. In addition, it shall

            to complete the application process. For example, to be denied for

            control reviewer reapplies after 125 days from the end of the annual
            review period, the household shall not be determined ineligible for

            during the completed review period, but must provide verification in
            accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ix) of this section. If a household
            terminated for refusal to cooperate with a Federal quality control
            reviewer reapplies after nine months from the end of the annual
            review period, the household shall not be determined ineligible for

            that one or more household members no longer resides with a
            household terminated for refusal to cooperate, the penalty for
            refusal to cooperate will attach to household of the person(s) who

            which household member(s) refused to cooperate, the State agency
            shall determine the household to which the penalty shall apply.

             Except for households certified for longer than 12 months, and
            except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, households
            must have a face-to-face interview with an eligibility worker at
            initial certification and at least once every 12 months thereafter.
            State agencies may not require households to report for an in-office
            interview during their certification period, though they may request
            households to do so. For example, State agencies may not require
            households to report en masse for an in-office interview during
            their certification periods simply to review their case files, or
            for any other reason. Interviews may be conducted at the food stamp
            office or other mutually acceptable location, including a
            household&apos;s residence. If the interview will be conducted at
            the household&apos;s residence, it must be scheduled in advance with
            the household. If a household in which all adult members are elderly
            or disabled is certified for 24 months in accordance with

            , a face-to-face interview is not required during the certification
            period. The individual interviewed may be the head of household,
            spouse, any other responsible member of the household, or an
            authorized representative. The applicant may bring any person he or
            she chooses to the interview. The interviewer must not simply review
            the information that appears on the application, but must explore
            and resolve with the household unclear and incomplete information.
            The interviewer must advise households of their rights and
            responsibilities during the interview, including the appropriate
            application processing standard and the households&apos;
            responsibility to report changes. The interviewer must advise
            households that are also applying for or receiving PA benefits that
            time limits and other requirements that apply to the receipt of PA
            benefits do not apply to the receipt of food stamp benefits, and
            that households which cease receiving PA benefits because they have
            reached a time limit, have begun working, or for other reasons, may
            still qualify for food stamp benefits. The interviewer must conduct
            the interview as an official and confidential discussion of
            household circumstances. The State agency must 
            <PRTPAGE P='722' />
            protect the applicant&apos;s right to privacy during the interview.
            Facilities must be adequate to preserve the privacy and
            confidentiality of the interview.

             The State agency must notify the applicant that it will waive the
            face-to-face interview required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section
            in favor of a telephone interview on a case-by-case basis because of
            household hardship situations as determined by the State agency.
            These hardship conditions include, but are not limited to: Illness,
            transportation difficulties, care of a household member, hardships
            due to residency in a rural area, prolonged severe weather, or work
            or training hours which prevent the household from participating in
            an in-office interview. The State agency must document the case file
            to show when a waiver was granted because of a hardship. The State
            agency may opt to waive the face-to-face interview in favor of a
            telephone interview for all households which have no earned income
            and all members of the household are elderly or disabled. Regardless
            of any approved waivers, the State agency must grant a face-to-face
            interview to any household which requests one. The State agency has
            the option of conducting a telephone interview or a home visit that
            is scheduled in advance with the household if the office interview
            is waived.

             The State agency must schedule an interview for all applicant
            households who are not interviewed on the day they submit their
            applications. To the extent practicable, the State agency must
            schedule the interview to accommodate the needs of groups with
            special circumstances, including working households. The State
            agency must schedule all interviews as promptly as possible to
            insure eligible households receive an opportunity to participate
            within 30 days after the application is filed. The State agency must
            notify each household that misses its interview appointment that it
            missed the scheduled interview and that the household is responsible
            for rescheduling a missed interview. If the household contacts the
            State agency within the 30 day application processing period, the
            State agency must schedule a second interview. The State agency may
            not deny a household&apos;s application prior to the 30th day after
            application if the household fails to appear for the first scheduled
            interview. If the household requests a second interview during the
            30-day application processing period and is determined eligible, the
            State agency must issue prorated benefits from the date of
            application.

             The State agency must verify the eligible status of applicant
            aliens. If an alien does not wish the State agency to contact INS to
            verify his or her immigration status, the State agency must give the
            household the option of withdrawing its application or participating
            without that member. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Interim
            Guidance On Verification of Citizenship, Qualified Alien Status and
            Eligibility Under 
            <PRTPAGE P='723' />
            Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
            Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Interim Guidance) (
            <aref type='FREGIST'>
              62 FR 61344
            </aref>
            , November 17, 1997) contains information on acceptable documents
            and INS codes. State agencies should use the Interim Guidance until
            DOJ publishes a final rule on this issue. Thereafter, State agencies
            should consult both the Interim Guidance and the DOJ final rule.
            Where the Interim Guidance and the DOJ final rule conflict, the
            latter should control the verification of alien eligibility. As
            provided in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            , the following information may also be relevant to the eligibility
            of some aliens: date of admission or date status was granted;
            military connection; battered status; if the alien was lawfully
            residing in the United States on August 22, 1996; membership in
            certain Indian tribes; if the person was age 65 or older on August
            22, 1996; if a lawful permanent resident can be credited with 40
            qualifying quarters of covered work and if any Federal means-tested
            public benefits were received in any quarter after December 31,
            1996; or if the alien was a member of certain Hmong or Highland
            Laotian tribes during a certain period of time or is the spouse or
            unmarried dependent of such a person. The State agency must also
            verify these factors, if applicable to the alien&apos;s eligibility.
            The SSA Quarters of Coverage History System (QCHS) is available for
            purposes of verifying whether a lawful permanent resident has earned
            or can receive credit for a total of 40 qualifying quarters.
            However, the QCHS may not show all qualifying quarters. For
            instance, SSA records do not show current year earnings and in some
            cases the last year&apos;s earnings, depending on the time of
            request. Also, in some cases, an applicant may have work from
            uncovered employment that is not documented by SSA, but is countable
            toward the 40 quarters test. In both these cases, the individual,
            rather than SSA, would need to provide the evidence needed to verify
            the quarters.

             The State agency shall verify the social security number(s) (SSN)
            reported by the household by submitting them to the Social Security
            Administration (SSA) for verification according to procedures
            established by SSA. The State agency shall not delay the
            certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise eligible
            household solely to verify the SSN of a household member. Once an
            SSN has been verified, the State agency shall make a permanent
            annotation to its file to prevent the unnecessary reverification of
            the SSN in the future. The State agency shall accept as verified an
            SSN which has been verified by another program participating in the
            IEVS described in

            reasonably be accomplished. Verification of residency should be

            rules, State agencies should consult both the Interim Guidance and

            conflict, the latter

            if verification of citizenship or non-citizen national status was
            obtained for that program. If the household cannot obtain the forms

            Guidance and the household can provide a reasonable explanation as
            to why verification is not available, the State agency must accept a
            signed statement, under penalty of perjury, from a third party
            indicating a reasonable basis for personal knowledge that the member
            in question is a U.S. citizen or non-citizen national. The signed

            someone commit fraud. Absent verification or third party attestation
            of U.S. citizenship or non-citizen national status, the member whose

            verification of any other factor which affects household eligibility
            or allotment level, including household size where not questionable.
            Such verification may be required Statewide or throughout a project

             The State agency may establish its own standards for the use of

            are verified in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section and

            example, no standard may be applied which prescribes variances in
            verification based on race, religion, ethnic background or national
            origin, nor may a State standard target groups such as migrant
            farmworkers or American Indians for more intensive verification than
            other households. The options specified in this paragraph, shall not

            State agency, however, may negotiate with those SSA offices with

             If a State agency opts to verify a deductible expense and obtaining
            the verification may delay the household&apos;s certification, the
            State agency shall advise the household that its eligibility and
            benefit level may be determined without providing a deduction for
            the claimed but unverified expense. This provision also applies to
            the allowance of medical expenses as specified in paragraph
            (f)(1)(iv) of this section. Shelter costs would be computed without
            including the unverified components. The standard utility allowance
            shall be used if the household is entitled to claim it and has not
            verified higher actual costs. If the expense cannot be verified
            within 30 days of the date of application, the State agency shall
            determine the household&apos;s eligibility and benefit level without
            providing a deduction of the unverified expense. If the household
            subsequently provides the missing verification, the State agency
            shall redetermine the household&apos;s benefits, and provide
            increased benefits, if any, in accordance with the timeliness

            allow the household sufficient time, as defined in paragraph (h)(1)
            of this section, to verify the expense, the household shall be
            entitled to the restoration of benefits retroactive to the month of
            application, provided that the missing verification is supplied in
            accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section. If the household
            would be ineligible unless the expense is allowed, the
            household&apos;s application shall be handled as provided in

            use documentary evidence as the primary source of verification for
            all items except residency and household size. These items may be
            verified either through readily available documentary evidence or
            through a collateral contact, without a requirement being imposed
            that documentary evidence must be the primary source of
            verification. Documentary evidence consists of a written
            confirmation of a household&apos;s circumstances. Examples of
            documentary evidence include wage stubs, rent receipts, and utility
            bills. Although documentary evidence shall be the primary source of
            verification, acceptable verification shall not be limited to any
            single type of document and may be obtained through the household or
            other source. Whenever documentary evidence cannot be obtained or is
            insufficient to make a firm determination of eligibility or benefit
            level, the eligibility worker may require collateral contacts or
            home visits. For example, documentary evidence may be considered
            insufficient when the household presents pay stubs which do not
            represent an accurate picture of the household&apos;s income (such
            as out-dated pay stubs) or identification papers that appear to be
            falsified.

             A collateral contact is an oral confirmation of a household&apos;s

            provide accurate third-party verification. When talking with

            required to use a collateral contact designated by the household if
            the collateral contact cannot be expected to provide an accurate
            third-party verification. When the collateral contact designated by
            the household is unacceptable, the State agency shall either
            designate another collateral contact, ask the household to designate
            another collateral contact or to provide an alternative form of
            verification, or substitute a home visit. The State agency is
            responsible for obtaining verification from acceptable collateral
            contacts.

            Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX), or through verification provided

            households, provided the State agency makes the appropriate data
            request to SSA and executes the necessary data exchange agreements

            income if the source has changed or the amount has changed by more
            than $50. Previously unreported medical expenses, actual utility
            expenses and total recurring medical expenses which have changed by
            more than $25 shall also be verified at recertification. The State
            agency shall not verify income if the source has not changed and if
            the amount is unchanged or has changed by $50 or less, unless the
            information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated. The
            State agency shall also not verify total medical expenses, or actual
            utility expenses claimed by households which are unchanged or have
            changed by $25 or less, unless the information is incomplete,
            inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated. For households eligible for
            the child support deduction or exclusion, the State agency may use
            information provided by the State CSE agency in determining the
            household&apos;s legal obligation to pay child support, the amount
            of its obligation and amounts the household has actually 
            <PRTPAGE P='730' />
            paid if the household pays its child support exclusively through its
            State CSE agency and has signed a statement authorizing release of
            its child support payment records to the State agency. A household
            would not have to provide any additional verification unless they
            disagreed with the information provided by the State CSE agency.
            State agencies that choose to use information provided by their
            State CSE agency in accordance with this paragraph (f)(8)(i)(A) must
            specify in their State plan of operation that they have selected
            this option. For all other households eligible for the child support
            deduction or exclusion, the State agency shall require the household
            to verify any changes in the legal obligation to pay child support,
            the obligated amount, and the amount of legally obligated child
            support a household member pays to a nonhousehold member. The State
            agency shall verify reportedly unchanged child support information
            only if the information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or
            outdated.

          State agencies also may verify factors other than identity, residency,

          expedited processing standards. State agencies should attempt to

          entitled to expedited service for the full timeframes specified in

            the verification requirements that were postponed. For subsequent
            months, the household must reapply and satisfy the verification
            requirements which were postponed or be certified under normal
            processing standards. If the household does not satisfy the
            postponed verification requirements and does not attend the
            interview, the State agency does not need to contact the household
            again. When a certification period of longer than 2 months is
            assigned and verification is postponed, households must be sent a 
            <PRTPAGE P='738' />
            notice of eligibility advising that no benefits for the third month
            will be issued until the postponed verification requirements are
            satisfied. The notice must also advise the household that if the
            verification process results in changes in the household&apos;s
            eligibility or level of benefits, the State agency will act on those
            changes without advance notice of adverse action.

             The State agency must notify households applying for public
            assistance (PA) of their right to apply for food stamp benefits at
            the same time and must allow them to apply for food stamp benefits
            at the same time they apply for PA benefits. The State agency must
            also notify such households that time limits or other requirements
            that apply to the receipt of PA benefits do not apply to the receipt
            of food stamp benefits, and that households which cease receiving PA
            benefits because they have reached a time limit, have begun working,
            or for other reasons, may still qualify for food stamp benefits. If
            the State agency attempts to discourage households from applying for
            cash assistance, it shall make clear that the disadvantages and
            requirements of applying for cash assistance do not apply to food
            stamps. In addition, it shall encourage applicants to continue with
            their application for food stamps. The State agency shall inform
            households that receiving food stamps will have no bearing on any
            other program&apos;s time limits that may apply to the household.
            The State agency may process the applications of such households in
            accordance with the requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this
            section, and the State agency must base their eligibility solely on
            food stamp eligibility criteria unless the household is
            categorically eligible, as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this
            section. If a State has a single Statewide GA application form,
            households in which all members are included in a 
            <PRTPAGE P='739' />
            State or local GA grant may have their application for food stamps
            included in the GA application form. State agencies may use the
            joint application processing procedures described in paragraph
            (j)(1) of this section for GA recipients in accordance with
            paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The State agency must base
            eligibility of jointly processed GA households solely on food stamp
            eligibility criteria unless the household is categorically eligible
            as provided in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. The State agency
            must base the benefit levels of all households solely on food stamp
            criteria. The State agency must certify jointly processed and
            categorically eligible households in accordance with food stamp
            procedural, timeliness, and notice requirements, including the 7-day
            expedited service provisions of paragraph (i) of this section and
            normal 30-day application processing standards of paragraph (g) of
            this section. Individuals authorized to receive PA, SSI, or GA
            benefits but who have not yet received payment are considered
            recipients of benefits from those programs. In addition, individuals
            are considered recipients of PA, SSI, or GA if their PA, SSI, or GA
            benefits are suspended or recouped. Individuals entitled to PA, SSI,
            or GA benefits but who are not paid such benefits because the grant
            is less than a minimum benefit are also considered recipients. The
            State agency may not consider as recipients those individuals not
            receiving GA, PA, or SSI benefits who are entitled to Medicaid only.

            of eligibility which are needed solely for purposes of determining
            the household&apos;s eligibility for food stamps. For those factors
            of eligibility which are needed to determine both PA eligibility and
            food stamp eligibility, the State agency may use the PA verification
            rules. However, if the household has provided the State agency
            sufficient verification to meet the verification requirements of
            paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section, but has failed to
            provide sufficient verification to meet the PA verification rules,
            the State agency may not use such failure as a basis for denying the

            processing requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. Under
            these circumstances, the State agency must process the

            based on its compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1)

             In order to determine if a household will be eligible due to its
            status as a recipient PA/SSI household, the State agency may
            temporarily postpone, within the 30-day processing standard, the
            food stamp eligibility determination if the household is not
            entitled to expedited service and appears to be categorically
            eligible. However, the State agency shall postpone denying a
            potentially categorically eligible household until the 30th day in
            case the household is determined eligible to receive PA benefits.
            Once the PA application is approved, the household is to be

            initial PA payment, but the payment will not be received until a

            food stamp benefit level according to the anticipated receipt of the
            payment and notify the household. Portions of initial PA payments
            intended to retroactively cover a previous month shall be

            suspends or terminates the household&apos;s food stamp benefits,
            provided the household is notified in advance that its benefits may
            be reduced, suspended, or terminated when the grant is received. The

            to their release from the institution shall be paid benefits from

            the State agency must update and reevaluate the original application
            of a denied case, the State agency shall not reinterview the
            household, but shall use any available information to update the

            agency and to determine if other changes in household circumstances
            have occurred. If any information obtained from the household
            differs from that which the State agency obtained from available

             As part of the SSA-State agency joint food stamp processing
            agreement, States may negotiate, on behalf of project areas, to have
            SSA provide initial eligibility and payment data where the local
            area is unable to access accurate and timely data through the
            State&apos;s SDX. However, in negotiating such agreements, SSA may
            challenge a State&apos;s determination that it does not have the
            computer capability to use SDX data. If SSA, FNS, and the State are

            have the capability to provide accurate and timely SDX data to the
            food stamp project area, SSA is not required to provide alternate
            means of transmitting initial SSI eligibility and payment data.

             If a State agency has determined that an authorized representative
            has knowingly provided false information about household
            circumstances or has made improper use of coupons, it may disqualify
            that person from being an authorized representative for up to one
            year. The State agency must send written notification to the
            affected household(s) and the authorized representative 30 days
            prior to the date of disqualification. The notification must specify
            the reason for the proposed action and the household&apos;s right to
            request a fair hearing. This provision is not applicable in the case
            of drug and alcoholic treatment centers and those group homes which
            act as authorized representatives for their residents. However, drug
            and alcohol treatment centers and the heads of group living

          received any Federal means-tested public benefit, as defined by the
          agency providing the benefit, or actually received food stamps is not
          creditable toward the 40-quarter total. Likewise, a parent&apos;s or
          spouse&apos;s quarter is not creditable if the parent or spouse
          actually received any Federal means-tested public benefit or actually
          received food stamps in that quarter. The State agency must evaluate
          quarters of coverage and receipt of Federal means-tested public
          benefits on a calendar year basis. The State agency must first
          determine the number of quarters creditable in a calendar year, then
          identify those quarters in which the alien (or the parent(s) or spouse
          of the alien) received Federal means-tested public benefits and then
          remove those quarters from the number of quarters of coverage earned
          or credited to the alien in that calendar year. However, if the alien
          earns the 40th quarter of coverage prior to applying for food stamps
          or any other Federal means-tested public benefit in that same quarter,
          the State agency must allow that quarter toward the 40 qualifying
          quarters total;

            person indicates inability or unwillingness to provide documentation
            of alien status, the State agency must classify that person as an
            ineligible alien. In such cases the State agency must not continue
            efforts to obtain that documentation.

             For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), only in the event a
            sponsored alien is an eligible alien in accordance with paragraph
            (a) of this section will the State agency consider available to the
            household the income and resources of the sponsor and spouse. For
            purposes of determining the eligibility and benefit level of a
            household of which an eligible sponsored alien is a member, the
            State agency must deem the income and resources of sponsor and the

            I-864A, as the unearned income and resources of the sponsored alien.
            The State agency must deem the sponsor&apos;s income and resources
            until the alien gains U. S. citizenship, has worked or can receive
            credit for 40 qualifying quarters of work as described in paragraph

            income plus any cash, food, housing, or other assistance provided by
            other individuals, including the sponsor(s). Prior to determining
            whether an alien is indigent, the State agency must explain the
            purpose of the determination to the alien and/or household
            representative and provide the alien and/or household representative
            the opportunity to refuse the determination. If the household
            refuses the determination, the State agency will not complete the
            determination and will deem the sponsor&apos;s income and resources
            to the alien&apos;s household in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of
            this section. The State agency must inform the sponsored alien of
            the consequences of refusing this determination. For purposes of
            this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), the phrase “is unable to obtain food and
            shelter” means that the sum of the eligible sponsored alien&apos;s
            household&apos;s own income, the cash contributions of the sponsor
            and others, and the value of any in-kind assistance the sponsor and
            others provide, does not exceed 130 percent of the poverty income
            guideline for the household&apos;s size. The State agency must
            determine the amount of income and other assistance provided in the
            month of application. If the alien is indigent, the only amount that
            the State agency must deem to such an alien will be the amount
            actually provided for a period beginning on the date of such
            determination and ending 12 months after such date. Each indigence
            determination is renewable for additional 12-month periods. The
            State agency must notify the Attorney General of each such
            determination, including the names of the sponsor and the sponsored
            alien involved. State

            agencies may develop an administrative process under which
            information about the sponsored alien is not shared with the
            Attorney General or the sponsor without the sponsored alien&apos;s
            consent. The State agency must inform the sponsored alien of the
            consequences of failure to provide such consent. If the sponsored
            alien fails to provide consent, he or she shall be ineligible
            pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, and the State agency
            shall determine the eligibility and benefit level of the remaining

             During the period the alien is subject to deeming, the eligible
            sponsored alien is responsible for obtaining the cooperation of the
            sponsor and for providing the State agency at the time of
            application and at the time of recertification with the information
            and documentation necessary to calculate deemed income and resources
            in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(v) of this
            section. The eligible sponsored alien is responsible for providing
            the names and other identifying factors of other aliens for whom the
            alien&apos;s sponsor has signed an affidavit of support. The State
            agency must attribute the entire amount of income and resources to
            the applicant eligible sponsored alien until he or she provides the
            information specified under this paragraph (c)(4). The eligible
            sponsored alien is also responsible for reporting the required
            information about the sponsor and sponsor&apos;s spouse should the
            alien obtain a different sponsor during the certification period and

            sponsor&apos;s spouse change or lose employment or die during the

            carry out the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the
            sponsored alien is ineligible. The State agency must determine the
            eligibility of any remaining household members. The State agency
            must consider available to the remaining household members the
            income and resources of the ineligible alien (excluding the deemed
            income and resources of the alien&apos;s sponsor and sponsor&apos;s
            spouse) in determining the eligibility and benefit level of the
            remaining household members in accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              §

              </subref>
            </aref>
            . If the sponsored alien refuses to cooperate in providing
            information or verification, other adult members of the alien&apos;s
            household are responsible for providing the information or
            verification required in accordance with the provisions of 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              §

              </subref>
            </aref>
            . If the State agency subsequently receives information or
            verification, it must act on the information as a reported change in
            household membership in accordance with the timeliness standards in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            household, the entire household is ineligible until such time as the
            household provides the needed sponsor information or verification.
            The State agency must assist aliens in obtaining verification in
            accordance with the provisions of

             In determining if good cause exists for failure to comply with the
            requirement to apply for or provide the State agency with an SSN,
            the State agency shall consider information from the household
            member, SSA and the State agency (especially if the State agency was
            designated to send the SS-5 to SSA and either did not process the
            SS-5 or did not process it in a timely manner). Documentary evidence
            or collateral information that the household member has applied for
            an SSN or made every effort to supply SSA with the necessary
            information to complete an application for an SSN shall be
            considered good cause for not complying timely with this
            requirement. Good cause does not include delays due to illness, lack
            of transportation or temporary absences, because SSA makes
            provisions for mail-in applications in lieu of applying in person.
            If the household member can show good cause why an application for a
            SSN has not been completed in a timely manner, that person shall be
            allowed to participate for one month in addition to the month of
            application. If the household member applying for an SSN has been
            unable to obtain the documents required by SSN, the State agency
            caseworker should make every effort to assist the individual in
            obtaining these documents. Good cause for failure to apply must be
            shown monthly in order for such a household member to continue to
            participate. Once an application has been filed, the State agency
            shall permit the member to continue to participate pending
            notification of the State agency of the household member&apos;s SSN.

             The State agency must register for work each household member not
            exempted by the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. As
            part of the work registration process, the State agency must explain
            to the individual the pertinent work requirements, the rights and
            responsibilities of work-registered household members, and the
            consequences of failure to comply. The State agency must provide a
            written statement of the above to each individual in the household
            who is registered for work. A notice must also be provided when a
            previously exempt individual or new household member becomes subject
            to a work requirement, and at recertification. The State agency must
            permit the applicant to complete a record or form for each household
            member required to register for employment in accordance with
            paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Household members are
            considered to have registered when an identifiable work registration
            form is submitted to the State agency or when the registration is
            otherwise annotated or recorded by the State agency.

             No State agency will receive less than $50,000 in Federal E&amp;T

            each State agency allocated more than $50,000. In order to guarantee
            an equitable reduction, FNS will calculate grants as follows. First,
            disregarding those State agencies scheduled to receive less than
            $50,000, 
            <PRTPAGE P='765' />
            FNS will calculate each remaining State agency&apos;s percentage
            share of the fiscal year&apos;s E&amp;T grant. Next, FNS will
            multiply the grant—less $50,000 for every State agency under the
            minimum—by each remaining State agency&apos;s same percentage share
            to arrive at the revised amount. The difference between the original
            and the revised amounts will represent each State agency&apos;s
            contribution. FNS will distribute the funds from the reduction to
            State agencies initially allocated less than $50,000.

            fiscal year on a first come-first served basis. Each year FNS will
            notify all State agencies of the availability of carryover funding.
            Interested State agencies must submit their requests for carryover
            funding to FNS. If the requests are determined reasonable and

            relative to the level of the State agency&apos;s E&amp;T spending in

             A State agency must use E&amp;T program grants to fund the
            administrative costs of planning, implementing and operating its
            food stamp E&amp;T program in accordance with its approved State
            E&amp;T plan. E&amp;T grants must not be used for the process of
            determining whether an individual must be work registered, the work
            registration process, or any further screening performed during the
            certification process, nor for sanction activity that takes place
            after the operator of an E&amp;T component reports noncompliance
            without good cause. For purposes of this paragraph (d), the
            certification process is considered ended when an individual is
            referred to an E&amp;T component for assessment or participation.
            E&amp;T grants may also not be used to subsidize the wages of
            participants, or to reimburse participants under paragraph (d)(3) of
            this section.

             A State agency&apos;s receipt of its 100 percent Federal E&amp;T
            grant is contingent on FNS&apos;s approval of the State
            agency&apos;s E&amp;T plan. If an adequate plan is not submitted,
            FNS may reallocate a State agency&apos;s grant among other State
            agencies with approved plans. Non-receipt of an E&amp;T grant does
            not release a State agency from its responsibility under paragraph
            (c)(4) of this section to operate an E&amp;T program.

             If a participating State agency notifies FNS that it will not
            obligate 
            <PRTPAGE P='767' />
            or expend its entire share of the additional funding allocated to it
            for a fiscal year, FNS will reallocate the unobligated, unexpended
            funds to other participating State agencies during the fiscal year,
            as it considers appropriate and equitable, on a first come-first
            served basis. FNS will notify other pledge States of the
            availability of additional funding. To qualify, a pledge State must
            have already obligated its entire annual 100 percent Federal E&amp;T
            grant, excluding an amount that is proportionate to the number of
            months remaining in the fiscal year, and it must guarantee in
            writing that it intends to obligate its entire grant by the end of
            the fiscal year. A State&apos;s annual 100 percent Federal E&amp;T
            grant is its share of the regular 100 percent Federal E&amp;T
            allocation plus its share of the additional $20 million (if
            applicable). Interested pledge States must submit their requests for
            additional funding to FNS. FNS will review the requests and, if they
            are determined reasonable and necessary, will reallocate some or all
            of the unobligated, unspent ABAWD funds.

             Unlike the funds allocated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of

            available until obligated or expended. Unobligated funds from this
            grant must be returned to the U.S. Treasury at the end of each
            fiscal year.

             The cost of serving at-risk ABAWDs is not an acceptable reason to
            fail to live up to the pledge. A slot must be made available and the
            ABAWD must be served even if the State agency exhausts all of its
            100 percent Federal E&amp;T funds and must use State funds to
            guarantee an opportunity for all at-risk ABAWDs to remain eligible
            beyond the 3-month time limit. State funds expended in accordance
            with the approved State E&amp;T Plan are eligible for 50 percent
            Federal match. If a participating State agency fails, without good
            cause, to meet its commitment, it may be disqualified from
            participating in the subsequent fiscal year or years.

             The State agency must provide payments to participants in its
            E&amp;T program, including applicants and volunteers, for expenses
            that are reasonably necessary and directly related to participation
            in the E&amp;T program. The Federal government will fund 50 percent
            of State agency payments for allowable expenses, except that Federal
            matching for dependent care expenses is limited to the maximum
            amount specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. These
            payments may be provided as a reimbursement for expenses incurred or
            in advance as payment for anticipated expenses in the coming month.
            The State agency must inform each E&amp;T participant that allowable
            expenses up to the amounts specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and
            (d)(4)(ii) of this section will be reimbursed by the State agency
            upon presentation of appropriate documentation. Reimbursable costs
            may include, but are not limited to, dependent care costs,
            transportation, and other work, training or education related
            expenses such as uniforms, personal safety items or other necessary
            equipment, and books or training manuals. These costs must not
            include the cost of meals away from home. If applicable, any
            allowable costs incurred by a noncompliant E&amp;T participant after
            the expiration of the noncompliant participant&apos;s minimum
            mandatory disqualification period, as established by the State
            agency, that are reasonably necessary and directly related to
            reestablishing eligibility, as defined by the State agency, are
            reimbursable under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(ii) of this
            section. The State agency may reimburse participants for expenses
            beyond the amounts specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) of this
            section; however, only costs that are up to but not in excess of
            those amounts are subject to Federal cost sharing. Reimbursement
            must not be provided from E&amp;T grants allocated under paragraph

            lowest. The payment rates for child

            , and are based on local market rate surveys. The State agency will
            provide a dependent care reimbursement to an E&amp;T participant for
            all dependents requiring care unless otherwise prohibited by this
            section. The State agency will not provide a reimbursement for a
            dependent age 13 or older unless the dependent is physically and/or
            mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself or is under
            court supervision. The State agency must provide a reimbursement for
            all dependents who are physically and/or mentally incapable of
            caring for themselves or who are under court supervision, regardless
            of age, if dependent care is necessary for the participation of a
            household member in the E&amp;T program. The State agency will
            obtain verification of the physical and/or mental incapacity for
            dependents age 13 or older if the physical and/or mental incapacity
            is questionable. Also, the State agency will verify a court-imposed
            requirement for the supervision of a dependent age 13 or older if
            the need for dependent care is questionable. If more than one
            household member is required to participate in an E&amp;T program,
            the State agency will reimburse the actual cost of dependent care or
            the applicable payment rate for child care, whichever is lowest, for
            each dependent in the household, regardless of the number of
            household members participating in the E&amp;T program. An
            individual who is the caretaker relative of a dependent in a family
            receiving cash assistance under title IV-A of the Social Security
            Act in a local area where an employment, training, or education
            program under title IV-A is in operation is not eligible for such
            reimbursement. An E&amp;T participant is not entitled to the
            dependent care reimbursement if a member of the E&amp;T
            participant&apos;s food stamp household provides the dependent care
            services. The State agency must verify the participant&apos;s need
            for dependent care and the cost of the dependent care prior to the
            issuance of the reimbursement. The verification must include the
            name and address of the dependent care provider, the cost and the
            hours of service (e.g., five hours per day, five days per week for
            two weeks). A participant may not be reimbursed for dependent care
            services beyond that which is required for participation in the
            E&amp;T program. In lieu of providing reimbursements for dependent
            care expenses, a State agency may arrange for dependent care through
            providers by the use of purchase of service contracts, by providing
            vouchers to the household or by other means. A State agency may
            require that dependent care provided or arranged by the State agency
            meet all applicable standards of State and local law, including
            requirements designed to ensure basic health and safety protections
            (e.g., fire safety). An E&amp;T participant may refuse available
            appropriate dependent care as provided or arranged by the State
            agency, if the participant can arrange other dependent care or can
            show that such refusal will not prevent or interfere with
            participation in the E&amp;T program as required by the State
            agency.

             To be considered acceptable by FNS, any component offered by a

            approximately 12 hours a month for two months making job contacts
            (less in workfare or work experience components if the
            household&apos;s benefit divided by the minimum wage is less than

            participate in job search from the time an application is filed for
            an initial period established by the State agency. Following this
            initial period (which may extend beyond the date when eligibility is
            determined) the State agency may require an additional job search
            period in any period of 12 consecutive months. The first such period
            of 12 consecutive months will begin at any time following the close
            of the initial period. The State agency may establish a job search
            period that, in its estimation, will provide participants a
            reasonable opportunity to find suitable employment. The State agency
            should not, however, establish a continuous, year-round job search

            noncompliance it must determine whether good cause for the
            noncompliance exists, as discussed in paragraph (i) of this section.
            Within 10 days of establishing that the noncompliance was without
            good cause, the State agency must provide the individual with a

             When a food stamp household reports the loss or denial of title
            IV-A or unemployment compensation benefits, or if the State agency
            otherwise learns of a loss or denial, the State agency must

             The voluntary quit provision applies if the employment involved 30
            hours or more per week or provided weekly earnings at least
            equivalent to the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours; the
            quit occurred within a period established by the State agency
            between 30 to 60 days prior to the date of application or anytime
            thereafter; and the quit was without good cause. Changes in
            employment status that result from terminating a self-employment
            enterprise or resigning from a job at the demand of the employer
            will not be considered a voluntary quit for purposes of this
            paragraph (j). An employee of the Federal Government, or of a State
            or local government who participates in a strike against such
            government, and is dismissed from his or her job because of
            participation in the strike, will be considered to have voluntarily
            quit his or her job without good cause. If an individual quits a
            job, secures new employment at comparable wages or hours and is then
            laid off or, through no fault of his own, loses the new job, the
            individual must not be disqualified for the earlier quit.

             The reduction of work effort provision applies if, before the
            reduction, the individual was employed 30 hours or more per week;
            the reduction occurred within a period established by the State
            agency between 30 and 60 days prior to the date of application or
            anytime thereafter; and the reduction was voluntary and without good
            cause. If the individual reduces his or her work hours to less than
            30 a week, but continues to earn weekly wages that exceed the
            Federal minimum wage multiplied by 30 hours, the individual remains
            exempt from Program work requirements, in accordance with paragraph
            (b)(1)(vii) of this section, and the reduction in work effort
            provision does not apply. Minor variations in the number of hours
            worked or in the weekly minimum wage equivalent wages are inevitable
            and must be taken into consideration when assessing a
            recipient&apos;s compliance with Program work rules.

            E&amp;T plan in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)
            of this section. If it is operated independent of the E&amp;T
            program, the State agency must submit a workfare plan to FNS for its
            approval. For the purpose of this paragraph (m), a political
            subdivision is any local government, including, but not limited to,
            any county, city, town or parish. A State agency may implement a

            political subdivision&apos;s workfare plan to its own State Plan of

            Fiscal records and accountable documents must be retained for 3
            years from the date of fiscal or administrative closure of the
            workfare program. Fiscal closure, as used in this paragraph (m),
            means that workfare program obligations for or against the Federal
            government have been liquidated. Administrative closure, as used in
            this paragraph (m), means that the operating agency or Federal
            government has determined and documented that no further action to
            liquidate the workfare program obligation is appropriate. Fiscal
            records and accountable records must be kept in a manner that will

             The operating agency must reimburse participants for transportation

            purchased by regular employees. These other costs may not include
            the cost of meals away from home. No participant cost reimbursed

            Security Act or any other workfare program may be reimbursed under
            the food stamp workfare program. Only reimbursement of participant
            costs up to but not in excess of $25 per month for any participant
            will be subject to Federal cost sharing as provided in paragraph
            (m)(7) of this section. Reimbursed child care costs may not be

             If a workfare or work component requirement does not continue, the

            of an intentional program violation, an inadvertent household error,
            or a State agency error. For an intentional program violation a
            claim should be established for the entire amount of the
            overissuance. If the overissuance was caused by an inadvertent
            household error or State agency error, the State agency must
            determine whether the number of hours worked in workfare are more
            than the number which could have been assigned had the proper
            benefit level been used in calculating the number of hours to work.
            A claim must be established for the amount of the overissuance not
            “worked off,” if any. If the hours worked equal the amount of hours
            calculated by dividing the overissuance by the minimum wage, no
            claim will be established. No credit for future work requirements
            will be given.

             State agencies and political subdivisions may operate workfare
            programs whereby participation by food stamp recipients is
            voluntary. In such a program, the penalties for failure to comply,
            as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will not apply for
            noncompliance. The amount of hours to be worked will be negotiated
            between the household and the operating agency, though not to exceed
            the limits provided under paragraph (m)(5)(ii) of this section. In
            addition, all protections provided under paragraph (m)(6)(i) of this
            section shall continue to apply. Those State agencies and political
            subdivisions choosing to operate such a program shall indicate in
            their workfare plan how their staffing will adapt to anticipated and
            unanticipated levels of participation. The Department will not
            approve plans which do not show that the benefits of the workfare
            program, in terms of hours worked by participants and reduced food
            stamp allotments due to successful job attainment, are expected to
            exceed the costs of such a program. In addition, if the Department
            finds that an approved voluntary program does not meet this
            criterion, the Department reserves the right to withdraw approval.

             Any Federal, State or local earned income tax credit received by
            any household member shall be excluded for 12 months, provided the
            household was participating in the Food Stamp Program at the time of

             The State agency must develop clear and uniform standards for
            identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the
            household is unable to sell for any significant return because the
            household&apos;s interest is relatively slight or the costs of
            selling the household&apos;s interest would be relatively great. The
            State agency must so identify a resource if its sale or other
            disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds
            for the support of the household or the cost of selling the resource
            would be relatively great. This provision does not apply to

             State agencies will be responsible for establishing methodologies
            for determining the fair market value of vehicles. In establishing
            such methodologies, the State agency must not increase the basic
            value of a vehicle by adding the value of low mileage or other
            factors such as optional equipment or special apparatus for the
            handicapped. Any household that claims that the State agency&apos;s
            determination of the value of its vehicle(s) is not accurate must be
            given the opportunity to acquire verification of the true value of

             PA provided to a third party on behalf of a household which is not
            specifically excluded from consideration as income under the
            provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (c)(1)(i)(E) of this
            section shall be considered for exclusion under this provision. To
            be considered emergency or special assistance and excluded under
            this provision, the assistance must be provided over and above the
            normal PA grant or payment, or cannot normally be provided as part
            of such grant or payment. If the PA program is composed of various
            standards or components, the assistance would be considered over and
            above the normal grant or not part of the grant if the assistance is
            not included as a regular component of the PA grant or benefit or
            the amount of assistance exceeds the maximum rate of payment for the
            relevant component. If the PA program is not composed of various
            standards or components but is designed to provide a basic monthly
            grant or payment for all eligible households and provides a larger
            basic grant amount for all households in a particular category,
            e.g., all households with infants, the larger amount is still part
            of the normal grant or benefit for such households and not an
            “extra” payment excluded under this provision. On the other hand, if
            a fire destroyed a household item and a PA program provides an
            emergency amount paid directly to a store to purchase a replacement,
            such a payment is excluded under this provision. If the PA program
            is not composed of various standards, allowances, or components but
            is simply designed to provide assistance on an as-needed basis
            rather than to provide routine, regular monthly benefits to a
            client, no exclusion would be granted under this provision because
            the assistance is not provided over and above the normal grant, it
            is the normal grant. If it is not clear whether a certain type of PA
            vendor payment is covered under this provision, the State agency
            shall apply to the appropriate FNS Regional Office for a
            determination of whether the PA vendor payments should be excluded.
            The application for this exclusion determination must explain the
            emergency or special nature of the vendor payment, the exact type of
            assistance it is intended to provide, who is eligible for the
            assistance, how the assistance is paid, and how the vendor payment
            fits into the overall PA benefit standard. A copy of the rules,
            ordinances, or statutes which create and authorize the program shall
            accompany the application request.

             A household receives court-ordered monthly support payments in the
            amount of $400. Later, $200 is diverted by the provider and paid
            directly to a creditor for a household expense. The payment is
            counted as income. Money deducted or diverted from a court-ordered
            support or alimony payment (or other binding written support or
            alimony agreement) to a third party for a household&apos;s expense
            shall be included as income because the payment is taken from money
            that is owed to the household. However, payments specified by a
            court order or other legally binding agreement to go directly to a
            third party rather than the household are excluded from income
            because they are not otherwise payable to the household. For
            example, a court awards support payments in the amount of $400 a
            month and in addition orders $200 to be paid directly to a bank for
            repayment of a loan. The $400 payment is counted as income and the
            $200 payment is excluded from income. Support payments not required
            by a court order or other legally binding agreement (including
            payments in excess of the amount specified in a court order or
            written agreement) which are paid to a third party on the
            household&apos;s behalf shall be excluded from income.

             A State agency may provide a standard homeless shelter deduction of
            $143 a month to households in which all members are homeless
            individuals but are not receiving free shelter throughout the month.
            The deduction must be subtracted from net income in determining
            eligibility and allotments for the households. The State agency may
            make a household with extremely low shelter costs ineligible for the
            deduction. A household receiving the homeless shelter deduction
            cannot have its shelter expenses considered under paragraphs
            (d)(6)(ii) or (d)(6)(iii) of this section. However, a homeless
            household may choose to claim actual costs under paragraph
            (d)(6)(ii) of this section instead of the homeless shelter deduction
            if actual costs are higher and verified. A State agency that chooses
            to provide a homeless household shelter deduction must specify in
            its State plan of operation that it has selected this option.

            shelter expense deduction limits for fiscal year 2002 and future
            years by adjusting the previous year&apos;s limits to reflect
            changes in the shelter component and the fuels and utilities

             With FNS approval, a State agency may develop the following
            standard utility allowances (standards) to be used in place of
            actual costs in determining a household&apos;s excess shelter
            deduction: an individual standard for each type of utility expense;
            a standard utility allowance for all utilities that includes heating
            or cooling costs (HCSUA); and, a limited utility allowance (LUA)
            that includes electricity and fuel for purposes other than heating
            or cooling, water, sewerage, well and septic tank installation and
            maintenance, telephone, and garbage or trash collection. The LUA
            must include expenses for at least two utilities. However, at its
            option, the State agency may include the excess heating and cooling
            costs of public housing residents in the LUA if it wishes to offer
            the lower standard to such households. The State agency may use
            different types of standards but cannot allow households the use of
            two standards that include the same expense. In States in which the
            cooling expense is minimal, the State agency may include the cooling
            expense in the electricity component. The State agency may vary the
            allowance by factors such as household size, geographical area, or
            season. Only utility costs identified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of
            this section must be used in developing standards.

             The State agency must review the standards annually and make
            adjustments to reflect changes in costs, rounded to the nearest
            whole dollar. State agencies must provide the amounts of standards
            to FNS when they are changed and submit methodologies used in
            developing and updating standards to FNS for approval when the
            methodologies are developed or changed.

             A standard with a heating or cooling component must be made
            available to households that incur heating or cooling expenses
            separately from their rent or mortgage and to households that
            receive direct or indirect assistance under the Low Income Home
            Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (LIHEAA). A heating or cooling
            standard is available to households in private rental housing who
            are billed by their landlords on the basis of individual usage or
            who are charged a flat rate separately from their rent. However,
            households in public housing units which have central utility meters
            and which charge households only for 
            <PRTPAGE P='804' />
            excess heating or cooling costs are not entitled to a standard that
            includes heating or cooling costs based only on the charge for
            excess usage unless the State agency mandates the use of standard
            utility allowances in accordance with paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(E) of
            this section. Households that receive direct or indirect energy
            assistance that is excluded from income consideration (other than
            that provided under the LIHEAA) are entitled to a standard that
            includes heating or cooling only if the amount of the expense
            exceeds the amount of the assistance. Households that receive direct
            or indirect energy assistance that is counted as income and incur a
            heating or cooling expense are entitled to use a standard that
            includes heating or cooling costs. A household that has both an
            occupied home and an unoccupied home is only entitled to one
            standard.

             A State agency may mandate use of standard utility allowances for
            all households with qualifying expenses if the State has developed
            one or more standards that include the costs of heating and cooling
            and one or more standards that do not include the costs of heating
            and cooling, the standards will not result in increased program
            costs, and FNS approves the standard. The prohibition on increasing
            Program costs does not apply to necessary increases to standards
            resulting from utility cost increases. If the State agency chooses
            to mandate use of standard utility allowances, it must provide a
            standard utility allowance that includes heating or cooling costs to
            residents of public housing units which have central utility meters
            and which charge the households only for excess heating or cooling
            costs. The State agency also must not prorate a standard utility
            allowance that includes heating or cooling costs provided to a
            household that lives and shares heating or cooling expenses with
            others. In determining whether the standard utility allowances
            increase program costs, the State agency shall not consider any
            increase in costs that results from providing a standard utility
            allowance that includes heating or cooling costs to residents of
            public housing units which have central utility meters and which
            charge the households only for excess heating or cooling costs. The
            State agency shall also not consider any increase in costs that
            results from providing a full (

            cooling costs to a household that lives and shares heating or
            cooling expenses with others. Under this option households entitled
            to the standard may not claim actual expenses, even if the expenses
            are higher than the standard. Households not entitled to the
            standard may claim actual allowable expenses. Requests to use an LUA
            should include the approximate number of food stamp households that
            would be entitled to the nonheating and noncooling standard, the
            average utility costs prior to use of the mandatory standard, the
            proposed standards, and an explanation of how the standards were
            computed.

             A household&apos;s eligibility shall be determined for the month of
            application by considering the household&apos;s circumstances for
            the entire month of application. Most households will have the

            calendar month in which the household filed its application.
            However, State agencies may, with the prior approval of FNS, use a
            fiscal month if the State agency determines that it is more
            efficient and satisfies FNS that the accounting procedures fully
            comply with certification and issuance requirements contained in
            these regulations. A State agency may elect to use either a standard
            fiscal month for all households, such as from the 15th of one
            calendar month to the 15th of the next calendar month, or a fiscal

            application for someone applying on the 31st of a month is the 30th:

             For the purpose of determining the household&apos;s eligibility and

            income already received by the household during 
            <PRTPAGE P='807' />
            the certification period and any anticipated income the household
            and the State agency are reasonably certain will be received during
            the remainder of the certification period. If the amount of income
            that will be received, or when it will be received, is uncertain,
            that portion of the household&apos;s income that is uncertain shall
            not be counted by the State agency. For example, a household
            anticipating income from a new source, such as a new job or recently
            applied for public assistance benefits, may be uncertain as to the
            timing and amount of the initial payment. These moneys shall not be
            anticipated by the State agency unless there is reasonable certainty
            concerning the month in which the payment will be received and in
            what amount. If the exact amount of the income is not known, that
            portion of it which can be anticipated with reasonable certainty
            shall be considered as income. In cases where the receipt of income
            is reasonably certain but the monthly amount may fluctuate, the
            household may elect to income average. Households shall be advised
            to report all changes in gross monthly income as required by

             Income received during the past 30 days shall be used as an
            indicator of the income that is and will be available to the
            household during the certification period. However, the State agency
            shall not use past income as an indicator of income anticipated for
            the certification period if changes in income have occurred or can
            be anticipated. If income fluctuates to the extent that a 30-day
            period alone cannot provide an accurate indication of anticipated
            income, the State agency and the household may use a longer period
            of past time if it will provide a more accurate indication of
            anticipated fluctuations in future income. Similarly, if the
            household&apos;s income fluctuates seasonally, it may be appropriate
            to use the most recent season comparable to the certification
            period, rather than the last 30 days, as one indicator of
            anticipated income. The State agency shall exercise particular
            caution in using income from a past season as an indicator of income
            for the certification period. In many cases of seasonally
            fluctuating income, the income also fluctuates from one season in
            one year to the same season in the next year. However, in no event
            shall the State agency automatically attribute to the household the
            amounts of any past income. The State agency shall not use past
            income as an indicator of anticipated income when changes in income
            have occurred or can be anticipated during the certification period.

             Households may elect to have fluctuating expenses averaged.
            Households may also elect to have expenses which are billed less
            often than monthly averaged forward over the interval between
            scheduled billings, or, if there is no scheduled interval, averaged
            forward over the period the expense is intended to cover. For
            example, if a household receives a single bill in February which
            covers a 3-month supply of fuel oil, the bill may be averaged over
            February, March, and April. The household may elect to have one-time
            only expenses averaged over the entire certification period in which
            they are billed. Households reporting one-time only medical expenses
            during their certification period may elect to have a one-time
            deduction or to have the expense averaged over the remaining months
            of their certification period. Averaging would begin the month the
            change would become effective. For households certified for 24
            months that have one-time medical expenses, the State agency must
            use the following procedure. In averaging any one-time medical
            expense incurred by a household during the first 12 months, the
            State agency must give the household the option of deducting the
            expense for one month, averaging the expense over the remainder of
            the first 12 months of the certification period, or averaging the
            expense over the remaining months in the certification period.
            One-time expenses reported after the 12th month of the certification
            period will be deducted in one month or averaged over the remaining
            months in the certification period, at the household&apos;s option.

             The State agency shall calculate a household&apos;s expenses based
            on the expenses the household expects to be billed for during the
            certification period. Anticipation of the expense shall be based on
            the most recent month&apos;s bills, unless the household is
            reasonably certain a change will occur. When the household is not
            claiming the utility standard, the State agency may anticipate
            changes during the certification period based on last year&apos;s
            bills from the same period updated by overall price increases; or,
            if only the most recent bill is available, utility cost increases or
            decreases over the months of the certification period may be based
            on utility company estimates for the type of dwelling and utilities
            used by the household. The State agency shall not average past
            expenses, such as utility bills for the last several months, as a
            method of anticipating utility costs for the certification period.
            At certification and recertification, the household shall report and
            verify all medical expenses. The household&apos;s monthly medical
            deduction for the certification period shall be based on the
            information reported and verified by the household, and any
            anticipated changes in the household&apos;s medical expenses that
            can be reasonably expected to occur during the certification period
            based on available information about the recipient&apos;s medical
            condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current
            verified medical expenses. The household shall not be required to
            file reports about its medical expenses during the certification
            period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its medical
            expenses, the State agency shall verify the change in accordance
            with

            to acting on the change, or requiring the verification prior to the
            second normal monthly allotment after the change is reported. In the
            case of a reported change that would decrease the household&apos;s
            allotment, or make the household ineligible, the State agency shall
            act on the change without requiring verification, though

            month of application or in the following month is inappropriate to
            determine whether or not the income is terminated. For example, if
            income is received on a quarterly basis (e.g., on January 1, April
            1, July 1, and October 1), and the household applies in mid-January,
            the income should not be considered as coming from a terminated
            source merely because no further payments will be received in the
            balance of January or in February. The test for whether or not this
            household&apos;s income is terminated is whether the income is
            anticipated to be received in April. Therefore, for households that
            normally receive income less often than monthly, the income shall be
            considered as coming from a terminated source if it will not be
            received in the month in which the next payment would normally be

             Some employers provide travel advances to cover the travel costs of
            new employees who must journey to the location of their new
            employment. To the extent that these payments are excluded as
            reimbursements, receipt of travel advances will not affect the
            determination of when a household is destitute. However, if the
            travel advance is by written contract an advance of wages that will
            be subtracted from wages later earned by the employee, rather than a
            reimbursement, the wage advance shall count as income. In addition,
            the receipt of a wage advance for travel costs of a new employee
            shall not affect the determination of whether subsequent payments
            from the employer are from a new source of income, nor whether a
            household shall be considered destitute. For example, if a household
            applies on May 10, has received a $50 advance for travel from its

              Reduction of public assistance benefits.
            </head>
          </npcatch>
          <text>
             If the benefits of a household that is receiving public assistance
            are reduced under a Federal, State, or local means-tested public
            assistance program because of the failure of a food stamp household
            member to perform an action required under the assistance program or
            for fraud, the State agency shall not increase the household&apos;s
            food stamp allotment as the result of the decrease in income. In
            addition to prohibiting an increase in food stamp benefits, the
            State agency may impose a penalty on the household that represents a
            percentage of the food stamp allotment that does not exceed 25
            percent. The 25 percent reduction in food stamp benefits must be
            based on the amount of food stamp benefits the household should have
            received under the regular food stamp benefit formula, taking into
            account its actual (reduced) income. However, under no circumstances
            can the food stamp benefits be allowed to rise. Reaching a time
            limit for time-limited benefits, having a child that is not eligible
            because of a family cap, failing to reapply or complete the
            application process for continued assistance under the other
            program, failing to perform an action that the individual is unable
            to perform as opposed to refusing to perform, or failing to comply
            with a purely procedural requirement, shall not be considered a
            failure to perform an action required by an assistance program for
            purposes of this provision. A procedural requirement, which would
            not trigger a food 
            <PRTPAGE P='826' />
            stamp sanction, is a step that an individual must take to continue
            receiving benefits in the assistance program such as submitting a
            monthly report form or providing verification of circumstances. A
            substantive requirement, which would trigger a food stamp sanction,
            is a behavioral requirement in the assistance program designed to
            improve the well being of the recipient family, such as
            participating in job search activities. The State agency shall not
            apply this provision to individuals who fail to perform a required
            action at the time the individual initially applies for assistance.
            The State agency shall not increase food stamp benefits, and may
            reduce food stamp benefits only if the person is receiving such
            assistance at the time the reduction in assistance is imposed or the
            reduction in assistance is imposed at the time of application for
            continued assistance benefits if there is no break in participation.
            The individual must be certified for food stamps at the time of the
            failure to perform a required action for this provision to apply.
            Assistance benefits shall be considered reduced if they are
            decreased, suspended, or terminated.

            shall not be held responsible for noncompliance as long as the State
            agency has made a good faith effort to obtain the information. The
            State agency, rather than the household, shall be responsible for

            changes in those sanctions.

             The prohibition on increasing food stamp benefits applies for the
            duration of the reduction in the assistance program. If at any time
            the State agency can no longer ascertain the amount of the
            reduction, then the State agency may terminate the food stamp
            sanction. However, the sanction may not exceed the sanction in the
            other program. If the sanction is still in effect at the end of one
            year, the State agency shall review the case to determine if the
            sanction continues to be appropriate. If, for example, the household
            is not receiving assistance, it would not be appropriate to continue
            the sanction. Sanctions extended beyond one year must be reviewed at
            least annually but may be ended by the State agency at any time. It
            shall be concurrent with the reduction in the other assistance
            program to the extent allowed by normal food stamp change processing

            which would trigger a food stamp sanction, is a behavioral
            requirement in the assistance program designed to improve the well
            being of the recipient family, such as participating in job search

             Cooperating with the State Child Support Agency would make it more
            difficult for the individual to escape domestic violence or unfairly
            penalize the individual who is or has been victimized by such
            violence, or the individual who is at risk of further domestic
            violence. For purposes of this provision, the term “domestic
            violence” means the individual or child would be subject to physical
            acts that result in, or are threatened to result in, physical injury
            to the individual; sexual abuse; sexual activity involving a
            dependent child; being forced as the caretaker relative of a

             Certified households must report changes within 10 days of the date
            the change becomes known to the household. For reportable changes of
            income, the State agency may require that change to be reported as
            early as within 10 days of the date that the household becomes aware
            of the change or as late as within 10 days of the date that the
            household receives the first payment attributable to the change. For
            example, in the case of new employment, the State may require the
            household to report the change within 10 days of the date that the
            household becomes aware of the new employment, within 10 days of the
            date the employment begins or within 10 days of the date that the
            household receives its first paycheck. For households subject to
            semi-annual reporting, the household must report changes no later
            than 10 days from the end of the calendar month in which the change
            occurred, provided that the household has at least 10 days within
            which to report the change. Optional procedures for reporting
            changes are contained in paragraph (f) of this section for

             The State agency shall take prompt action on all changes to
            determine if the change affects the household&apos;s eligibility or
            allotment. However, the State agency has the option to disregard a
            reported change to an established deduction in accordance with
            paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If a household reports a change in
            income, and the new circumstance is expected to continue for at
            least one month beyond the month in which the change is reported,
            the State agency may act on the change in accordance with paragraphs
            (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The time frames in paragraphs
            (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply to these actions. During the
            certification period, the State agency shall not act on changes in
            the medical expenses of households eligible for the medical expense
            deduction which it learns of from a source other than the household
            and which, in order to take action, require the State agency to
            contact the household for verification. The State agency shall only
            act on those changes in medical expenses that it learns about from a
            source other than the household if those changes are verified upon
            receipt and do not necessitate contact with the household. Even if
            there is no change in the allotment, the State agency shall document
            the reported change in the casefile, provide another change report
            form to the household, and notify the household of the receipt of
            the change report. If the reported change affects the
            household&apos;s eligibility or level of benefits, the adjustment
            shall also be reported to the household. The State agency shall also
            advise the household of additional verification requirements, if
            any, and state that failure to provide verification shall result in
            increased benefits reverting to the original allotment. The State
            agency shall document the date a change is reported, which shall be
            the date the State agency receives a report form or is advised of
            the change over the telephone or by a personal visit. Restoration of
            lost benefits shall be provided to any household if the State agency
            fails to take action on a change which increases benefits within the
            time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

            later than the first allotment issued 10 days after the date the
            change was reported to the State agency. For example, a $30 decrease
            in income reported on the 15th of May would increase the
            household&apos;s June allotment. If the same decrease were reported
            on May 28, and the household&apos;s normal issuance cycle was on
            June 1, the household&apos;s allotment would have to be increased by
            July.

             For changes which result in an increase in a household&apos;s
            benefits due to the addition of a new household member who is not a
            member of another certified household, or due to a decrease of $50
            or more in the household&apos;s gross monthly income, the State
            agency shall make the change effective not later than the first
            allotment issued 10 days after the date the change was reported.
            However, in no event shall these changes take effect any later than
            the month following the month in which the change is reported.
            Therefore, if the change is reported after the 20th of a month and
            it is too late for the State agency to adjust the following
            month&apos;s allotment, the State agency shall issue a supplementary
            ATP or otherwise provide an opportunity for the household to obtain
            the increase in benefits by the 10th day of the following month, or
            the household&apos;s normal issuance cycle in that month, whichever
            is later. For example, a household reporting a $100 decrease in
            income at any time during May would have its June allotment
            increased. If the household reported the change after the 20th of
            May and it was too late for the State agency to adjust the ATP
            normally issued on June 1, the State agency would issue a
            supplementary ATP for the amount of the increase by June 10.

            provide the required verification within 10 days after the change is
            reported but does provide the verification at a later date, then the
            timeframes specified in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this

            verification is provided rather than from the date the change is

            the household does not provide verification, the household&apos;s
            benefits will revert to the original benefit level. Whenever a State
            agency increases a household&apos;s benefits to reflect a reported
            change and subsequent verification shows that the household was
            actually eligible for fewer benefits, the State agency shall

             The State agency shall establish procedures for making mass changes
            to reflect cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) in benefits and any
            other mass changes under RSDI, SSI, and other programs such as
            veteran&apos;s assistance under title 38 of the United States Code
            and the Black Lung Program, where information on COLA&apos;s is
            readily available and is applicable to all or a majority of those
            programs&apos; beneficiaries. A State agency may require households
            to report the change on the appropriate monthly report or may handle
            the change using the mass change procedures in this section. If the
            State agency requires the household to report the information on the
            monthly report, the State agency shall handle such information in
            accordance with its normal procedures. Households that are not
            required to report the change on the monthly report, and households
            not subject to monthly reporting, shall not be responsible for
            reporting these changes. The State agency shall be responsible for
            automatically adjusting these households&apos; SNAP benefit levels
            in accordance with either paragraph (e)(3)(i) or (e)(3)(ii) of this
            section.

            changes shall be reflected no later than the second allotment issued

            according to PA procedures and timeliness standards. However, the
            household must reapply for food stamp benefits if the food stamp
            certification period expires before the fair hearing process is
            completed. If the household does not appeal, the State agency must
            make the change effective in accordance with the procedures
            specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

             If the household&apos;s food stamp benefits will increase as a

            agency must issue the PA notice of adverse action, but must not take
            any action to increase the household&apos;s food stamp benefits
            until the household decides whether it will appeal the PA adverse
            action. If the household decides to appeal and its PA benefits are
            continued, the household&apos;s food stamp benefits must continue at
            the previous level. If the household does not appeal, the State

            PA benefits within its food stamp certification period, and the
            State agency does not have sufficient information to determine how
            the change affects the household&apos;s food stamp eligibility and
            benefit level (such as when an absent parent returns to a household,
            and the household asks to have its TANF case closed without
            providing any information on the income of the new household
            member), the State agency must take the following action:

             If the situation requires a reduction or termination of PA
            benefits, the State agency must issue a request for contact (RFC) in
            accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section at the same time
            it sends a PA notice of adverse action. Before taking further
            action, the State agency must wait until the household&apos;s PA
            notice of adverse action period expires or until the household
            requests a fair hearing, whichever occurs first. If the household
            requests a fair hearing and elects to have its PA benefits continued
            pending the appeal, the State agency must continue the
            household&apos;s food stamp benefits at the same level. If the
            household decides not to request a fair hearing and continuation of
            its PA benefits, the State agency must resume action on the changes
            as required in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

             Prior to any action to reduce or terminate a household&apos;s
            benefits within the certification period, the State agency shall,
            except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, provide the
            household timely and adequate advance notice before the adverse
            action is taken.

            advance notice period conforms to that period of time defined by the
            State agency as an adequate notice period for its public assistance
            caseload, provided that the period includes at least 10 days from
            the date the notice is mailed to the date upon which the action
            becomes effective. Also, if the adverse notice period ends on a
            weekend or holiday, and a request for a fair hearing and
            continuation of benefits is received the day after the weekend or
            holiday, the State agency shall consider the request timely

            request a fair hearing; the telephone number of the food stamp
            office (toll-free number or a number where collect calls will be
            accepted for households outside the local calling area) and, if
            possible, the name of the person to contact for additional
            information; the availability of continued benefits; and the

             The State agency must develop an application to be used by

            the initial application, a simplified version, a monthly reporting

            application form. A new household signature and date is required at
            the time of application for recertification. The recertification
            process can only be used for those households which apply for
            recertification prior to the end of their current certification
            period, except for delayed applications as specified in paragraph
            (e)(3) of this section. The process, at a minimum, must elicit from
            the household sufficient information that, when added to information
            already contained in the casefile, will ensure an accurate
            determination of eligibility and benefits. The State agency must

             to provide bilingual staff or interpreters who speak the
            appropriate language, the State agency shall insure that the hearing
            procedures are verbally explained in that language. Upon request,
            the State agency shall also help a household with its hearing
            request. If a household makes an oral request for a hearing, the
            State agency shall complete the procedures necessary to start the
            hearing process. Households shall be advised of any legal services
            available that can provide representation at the hearing.

            be reached. Hearing requests from these households shall be

            a decision and a restoration of benefits if the decision so
            indicates before they leave the area.

             The State agency electing to accept an oral expression from the
            household or its representative to withdraw a fair hearing may
            discuss the option with the household when it appears that the State
            agency and household have resolved issues related to the fair
            hearing. However, the State agency is prohibited from coercion or
            actions which would influence the household or its representative to
            withdraw the household&apos;s fair hearing request. The State agency
            must provide a written notice to the household within 10 days of the
            household&apos;s request confirming the withdrawal request and
            providing the household with an opportunity to request a hearing.
            The written notice must advise the household it has 10 days from the
            date it receives the notice to advise the State agency of its desire
            to request, or reinstate, the hearing. If the household timely
            advises the State agency that it wishes to reinstate the fair
            hearing, the State agency must provide the household with a fair
            hearing, within the time frames specified in paragraph (c) of this
            section and beginning the date the household advises the State
            agency that it wishes to reinstate its request. The State agency
            must reinstate a fair hearing as requested from a household at least
            once. The State agency must not deny a household&apos;s request for
            a fair hearing if the household is aggrieved by a State agency
            action that differs from the reinstated action.

            , and its certification period has not expired, the household&apos;s
            participation in the program shall be continued on the basis
            authorized immediately prior to the notice of adverse action, unless
            the household specifically waives continuation of benefits. The form
            for requesting a fair hearing shall contain space for the household
            to indicate whether or not continued benefits are requested. If the
            form does not positively indicate that the household has waived
            continuation of benefits, the State agency shall assume that
            continuation of benefits is desired and the benefits shall be issued
            accordingly. If the State agency action is upheld by the hearing
            decision, a claim against the household shall be established for all
            overissuances, with one exception. In the case of an EBT adjustment,

               of this chapter
            </aref>
            , once an adverse action is upheld, the State agency shall
            immediately debit the household&apos;s account for the total amount
            stated in its original notice. If there are no benefits or
            insufficient benefits remaining in the household&apos;s account at
            the time the State agency action is upheld, the State agency may
            only make the adjustment from the next month&apos;s benefits,
            regardless of whether this satisfies the full adjustment amount. If
            a hearing request is not made within the period provided by the
            notice of adverse action, benefits shall be reduced or terminated as
            provided in the notice. However, if the household establishes that
            its failure to make the request within the advance notice period was
            for good cause, the State agency shall reinstate the benefits to the
            prior basis. When benefits are reduced or terminated due to a mass
            change, participation on the prior basis shall be reinstated only if
            the issue being contested is that food stamp eligibility or benefits
            were improperly computed or that Federal law or regulation is being
            misapplied or misinterpreted by the State agency.

             The State agency shall be responsible for investigating any case of
            alleged intentional Program violation, and ensuring that appropriate
            cases are acted upon either through administrative disqualification
            hearings or referral to a court of appropriate jurisdiction in
            accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.
            Administrative disqualification procedures or referral for
            prosecution action should be initiated by the State agency in cases
            in which the State agency has sufficient documentary evidence to
            substantiate that an individual has intentionally made one or more
            acts of intentional Program violation as defined in paragraph (c) of
            this section. If the State agency does not initiate administrative
            disqualification procedures or refer for prosecution a case
            involving an overissuance caused by a suspected act of intentional
            Program violation, the State agency shall take action to collect the
            overissuance by establishing an inadvertent household error claim
            against the household in accordance with the procedures in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              § 
              <subref title='7' part='273' sect='18' psec='' tq='N'>

            </aref>
            . The State agency should conduct administrative disqualification
            hearings in cases in which the State agency believes the facts of
            the individual case do not warrant civil or criminal prosecution
            through the appropriate court system, in cases previously referred
            for prosecution that were declined by the appropriate legal
            authority, and in previously referred cases where no action was
            taken within a reasonable period of time and the referral was
            formally withdrawn by the State agency. The State agency shall not
            initiate an administrative disqualification hearing against an
            accused individual whose case is currently being referred for
            prosecution or subsequent to any action taken against the accused
            individual by the prosecutor or court of appropriate jurisdiction,
            if the factual issues of the case arise out of the same, or related,
            circumstances. The State agency may initiate administrative
            disqualification procedures or refer a case for prosecution
            regardless of the current eligibility of the individual.

             Each State agency shall establish a system for conducting
            administrative disqualifications for intentional Program violation
            which conforms with the procedures outlined in paragraph (e) of this
            section. FNS shall exempt any State agency from the requirement to
            establish an administrative disqualification system if the State
            agency has already entered into an agreement, pursuant to paragraph
            (g)(1) of this section, with the State&apos;s Attorney
            General&apos;s Office or, where necessary, with county prosecutors.
            FNS shall also exempt any State agency from the requirement to
            establish an administrative disqualification system if there is a
            State law that requires the referral of such cases for prosecution
            and if the State agency demonstrates to FNS that it is actually
            referring cases for prosecution and that prosecutors are following
            up on the State agency&apos;s referrals. FNS may require a State
            agency to establish an administrative disqualification system if it
            determines that the State agency is not promptly or actively
            pursuing suspected intentional Program violation claims through the
            courts.

             The State agency shall base administrative disqualifications for

            hearings in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section or on

            However, any State agency has the option of allowing accused
            individuals either to waive their rights to administrative
            disqualification hearings in accordance with paragraph (f) of this
            section or to sign disqualification consent agreements for cases of
            deferred adjudication in accordance with paragraph (h) of this
            section. Any State agency which chooses either of these options may
            base administrative disqualifications for intentional Program
            violation on the waived right to an administrative disqualification
            hearing or on the signed disqualification consent agreement in cases
            of deferred adjudication.

             The time and place of the hearing shall be arranged so that the
            hearing is accessible to the household member suspected of
            intentional Program violation. If the household member or its
            representative cannot be located or fails to appear at a hearing
            initiated by the State agency without good cause, the hearing shall
            be conducted without the household member being represented. Even
            though the household member is not represented, the hearing official
            is required to carefully consider the evidence and determine if
            intentional Program violation was committed based on clear and
            convincing evidence. If the household member is found to have
            committed an intentional Program violation but a hearing official
            later determines that the household member or representative had
            good cause for not appearing, the previous decision shall no longer
            remain valid and the State agency shall conduct a new hearing. The
            hearing official who originally ruled on the case may conduct the
            new hearing. In instances where good cause for failure to appear is
            based upon a showing of nonreceipt of the hearing notice as
            specified in paragraph 
            <PRTPAGE P='858' />
            (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the household member has 30 days after
            the date of the written notice of the hearing decision to claim good
            cause for failure to appear. In all other instances, the household
            member has 10 days from the date of the scheduled hearing to present
            reasons indicating a good cause for failure to appear. A hearing
            official must enter the good cause decision into the record.

             A pending disqualification hearing shall not affect the
            individual&apos;s or the household&apos;s right to be certified and
            participate in the Program. Since the State agency cannot disqualify
            a household member for intentional Program violation until the
            hearing official finds that the individual has committed intentional
            Program violation, the State agency shall determine the eligibility
            and benefit level of the household in the same manner it would be
            determined for any other household. For example, if the misstatement
            or action for which the household member is suspected of intentional
            Program violation does not affect the household&apos;s current
            circumstances, the household would continue to receive its allotment
            based on the latest certification action or be recertified based on
            a new application and its current circumstances. However, the
            household&apos;s benefits shall be terminated if the certification
            period has expired and the household, after receiving its notice of
            expiration, fails to reapply. The State agency shall also reduce or
            terminate the household&apos;s benefits if the State agency has
            documentation which substantiates that the household is ineligible
            or eligible for fewer benefits (even if these facts led to the
            suspicion of intentional Program violation and the resulting
            disqualification hearing) and the household fails to request a fair
            hearing and continuation of benefits pending the hearing. For
            example, the State agency may have facts which substantiate that a
            household failed to report a change in its circumstances even though
            the State agency has not yet demonstrated that the failure to report
            involved an intentional act of Program violation.

             The State agency may choose to provide administrative
            disqualification hearings at the local level in some or all of its
            project areas with a right to appeal to a State level hearing. If a
            local level disqualification hearing determines that a household
            member committed intentional Program violation, the notification of
            hearing decision described in paragraph (e)(9) of this section shall
            also inform the household member of the right to appeal the decision
            within 15 days after the receipt of the notice, the date the
            disqualification will take effect unless a State level hearing is
            requested, and that benefits will be continued pending a State level
            hearing if the household is otherwise eligible. If the household
            member appeals the local level decision, the advance notice of
            hearing, as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, shall be
            provided at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled State level
            hearing and shall also inform the household member that the local
            hearing decision will be upheld if the household or its
            representative fails to appear for the hearing without good cause.
            When a local level decision is appealed, the State agency shall
            conduct the State level hearing, arrive at a decision, and notify
            the household member and local agency of the decision within 60 days
            of the date the household member appealed its case. The prior
            decision shall not be taken into consideration by the State hearing

             If the court finds that the household member committed intentional
            Program violation, the State agency shall provide written notice to
            the household member. The notice shall be provided prior to

             Each State agency shall have the option of establishing procedures
            to allow accused individuals to sign disqualification consent
            agreements for cases of deferred adjudication. State agencies are
            encouraged to use this option for those cases in which a
            determination of guilt is not obtained from a court due to the
            accused individual having met the terms of a court order or which
            are not prosecuted due to the accused individual having met the
            terms of an agreement with the prosecutor. For State agencies which
            choose the option of allowing individuals to sign disqualification
            consent agreements in cases referred for prosecution, the procedures
            shall conform with the requirements outlined in this section.

             The disqualification of an individual for an intentional Program
            violation in one political jurisdiction shall be valid in another.
            However, one or more disqualifications for an intentional Program
            violation, which occurred prior to April 1, 1983, shall be
            considered as only one previous disqualification when determining
            the appropriate penalty to impose in a case under consideration,
            regardless of where the disqualification(s) took place. State
            agencies are encouraged to identify and report to FNS any
            individuals disqualified for an intentional Program violation prior
            to April 1, 1983. A State agency submitting such historical
            information should take steps to ensure the availability of
            appropriate documentation to support the disqualifications in the
            event it is contacted for independent verification.

            through the fair hearing process if the household disagrees with any

             Individuals disqualified for intentional Program violation are
            entitled to restoration of any benefits lost during the months that
            they were disqualified, not to exceed twelve months prior to the
            date of State agency notification, only if the decision which
            resulted in disqualification is subsequently reversed. For example,
            an individual would not be entitled to restoration of lost benefits
            for the period of disqualification based solely on the fact that a
            criminal conviction could not be obtained, unless the individual
            successfully challenged the disqualification period imposed by an
            administrative disqualification in a separate court action. For each
            month the individual was disqualified, not to exceed twelve months
            prior to State agency notification, the amount to be restored, if
            any, shall be determined by comparing the allotment the household
            received with the allotment the household would have received had
            the disqualified member been allowed to participate. If the
            household received a smaller allotment than it should have received,
            the difference equals the amount to be restored. Participation in an
            administrative disqualification hearing in which the household
            contests the State agency assertion of intentional Program violation
            shall be considered notification that the household is requesting
            restored benefits.

             Regardless of whether a household is currently eligible or
            ineligible, the State agency shall restore lost benefits to a
            household by issuing an allotment equal to the amount of benefits
            that were lost. The amount restored shall be issued in addition to
            the allotment currently eligible households are entitled to receive.
            The State agency shall honor reasonable requests by households to
            restore lost benefits in monthly installments if, for example, the
            household fears the excess coupons may be stolen, or that the amount
            to be restored is more than it can use in a reasonable period of
            time.

            benefits and/or State supplementary payments as a resident of
            California is eligible to receive food stamp benefits. The Secretary
            of the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that
            the SSI payments in California have been specifically increased to
            include the value of the food stamp allotment.

             In California, an individual must actually receive, not merely have
            applied for, SSI benefits to be determined ineligible for the food
            stamp program. If the State agency provides payments at least equal
            to the level of SSI benefits to individuals who have applied for but
            are awaiting an SSI eligibility determination, receipt of these
            substitute payments will terminate the individual&apos;s eligibility
            for food stamp benefits. Once SSI benefits are received, the
            individual will remain ineligible for food stamp benefits, even
            during months in which receipt of the SSI benefits is interrupted,
            or suspended, until the individual is terminated from the SSI
            program.

             This section provides for an MRRB system for determining household
            eligibility and benefits. For included households, this system
            replaces the prospective budgeting system provided in the preceding
            sections of this part. The MRRB system provides for the use of
            retrospective information in calculating household benefits,
            normally based on information submitted by the household in monthly
            reports. The State agency shall establish an MRRB system as follows:

            report and that this benefit does not reflect any changes in the

            household will be terminated.

             This subpart establishes rules under which Simplified Application
            and Standardized Benefit Projects shall operate. State agencies and
            political subdivisions chosen as project operators may designate
            households containing members receiving TANF, SSI, or Medicaid
            benefits as project eligible. Project eligible households shall have
            their food stamp eligibility determined using simplified application
            procedures. Food stamp eligibility shall be determined using
            information contained in their TANF, or Medicaid application, or, in
            the case of SSI, on the State Data Exchange (SDX) tape, and any
            appropriate addendum. Project-eligible households shall be
            considered categorically food stamp resource eligible based on their
            eligibility for these other programs and shall be required to meet
            food stamp income eligibility standards. However, income definitions
            appropriate to the TANF, SSI or Medicaid programs shall be used
            instead of food stamp income definitions in determining eligibility.
            In addition, such households shall, as a condition of program
            eligibility, meet and/or fulfill all food stamp nonfinancial
            eligibility requirements. (Project-eligible households defined as
            categorically eligible in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              § 273.2 (j) and (k) of
            </aref>
             these regulations are not required to meet the income eligibility
            standards.) To 
            <PRTPAGE P='887' />
            further simplify program administration, benefits provided to such
            households may be standardized by category of assistance and
            household size.

            in support of the waiver request. FNS will consider approving
            waivers for up to one year based on documentation covering a shorter
            period, but the State agency must show that the basis for the waiver
            is not a seasonal or short term aberration. We reserve the right to
            approve waivers for a shorter period at the State agency&apos;s
            request or if the data is insufficient. We reserve the right to
            approve a waiver for a longer period if the reasons are compelling.

            authorized) at the time of its application for the SFSP, the State

            time frame, and screening for and provision of expedited service if
            eligible. The State agency must determine under regular food stamp
            rules the eligibility and benefits of any household that it has
            found ineligible for TANF assistance because of time limits, more
            restrictive resource standards, or other rules that do not apply to
            food stamps.

             Legislation governing the SFSP requires that State plans must
            address the needs of households with high shelter costs relative to
            their income. If a State chooses to standardize shelter costs under
            the SFSP, it must, therefore, use multiple standards that take into
            consideration households with high shelter costs versus those with
            low shelter costs. A State is prohibited from using a single
            standard based on average shelter costs for all households
            participating in an SFSP.

             States must provide an opportunity for public input on proposed
            SFSP plans (with special attention to changes in benefit amounts
            that are necessary in order to ensure that the overall proposal not
            increase Federal costs) through a public comment period, public
            hearings, or meetings with groups representing participants&apos;
            interests. Final approval will be given after the State informs the
            Department about the comments received from the public. After the
            public comment period, the State agency must inform the Department
            about the comments received from the public and submit its final
            SFSP plan for Departmental approval.

        <P>
          The State agency may elect to provide households leaving TANF with
          transitional food stamp benefits as provided in this section. A State
          agency that chooses to provide transitional benefits must state in its
          State plan of operation that it has selected this option and specify
          the categories of households eligible for such benefits, the maximum
          number of months for which transitional benefits will be provided and
          any other items required to be included under this subpart H. The
          State agency may choose to limit transitional benefits to households
          in which all members had been receiving TANF, or it may provide such
          benefits to any household in which at least one member had been
          receiving TANF.
        </P>
        <P>
          The State agency may not provide transitional benefits to a household
          which is leaving TANF when:

            5 months the household&apos;s benefit amount after making an
            adjustment for the loss of TANF. This is the household&apos;s
            transitional period. To provide the full transitional period, the
            State agency may extend the certification period for up to 5 months
            and may extend the household&apos;s certification period beyond the

            income. At its option, the State agency may also adjust the benefit

          If the household does report changes in its circumstances during the
          transitional period, the State agency may make the change effective
          the month following the last month of the transitional period or
          invite the household to reapply and be certified to receive benefits.
          However, in order to prevent duplicate participation, the State agency
          must act to change the household&apos;s transitional benefit when a
          household member moves out of the household and either reapplies as a
          new household or is reported as a new member of another household.
          Moreover, the State agency must remove any income, resources and
          deductible expenses clearly attributable to the departing member.
