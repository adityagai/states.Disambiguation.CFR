          The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the
          full faith and credit of the United States and is not contestable
          except for fraud or misrepresentation (including negligent
          misrepresentation) of which the lender or holder has actual knowledge,
          participates in, or condones. A note which provides for the payment of
          interest on interest shall not be guaranteed and any Loan Note
          Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement attached to, or relating
          to, a note 
          <PRTPAGE P='728' />
          which provides for payment of interest on interest is void. The Loan
          Note Guarantee will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent any
          loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or
          failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at
          which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses
          occasioned will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent that
          loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically
          approved by the Agency in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.
          Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those
          services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing
          its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes
          not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not acting in a
          timely manner, acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a
          reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity,
          or until a final loss is paid. The Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment
          Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder shall not cover interest
          accruing 90 days after the holder has demanded repurchase by the
          lender, nor shall the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee
          Agreement in the hands of a holder cover interest accruing 90 days
          after the lender or Agency has requested the holder to surrender the
          evidence of debt for repurchase.

          , subpart G, of this title. The lender must assist the Agency to
          ensure that the lender&apos;s applicant complies with any mitigation
          measures required by the Agency&apos;s environmental review for the
          purpose of avoiding or reducing adverse environmental impacts of
          construction or operation of the facility financed with the guaranteed
          loan. This assistance includes ensuring that the lender&apos;s
          applicant is to take no actions (for example, initiation of
          construction) or incur any obligations with respect to their proposed
          undertaking that would either limit the range of alternatives to be
          considered 
          <PRTPAGE P='729' />
          during the Agency&apos;s environmental review process or which would
          have an adverse effect on the environment. If construction is started
          prior to completion of the environmental review and the Agency is
          deprived of its opportunity to fulfill its obligation to comply with
          applicable environmental requirements, the application for financial
          assistance may be denied. Satisfactory completion of the environmental
          review process must occur prior to Agency approval of the
          applicant&apos;s request or any commitment of Agency resources.

             The Agency must determine that the borrower is unable to obtain the
            required credit without the loan guarantee from private, commercial,
            or cooperative sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for
            similar purposes and periods of time. This determination shall
            become a part of the Agency casefile. The Agency must also determine
            if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a
            Federal Court (other than the U.S. Tax Court) has been entered
            against the borrower or if the borrower has an outstanding
            delinquent debt with any Federal agency. Such judgment or
            delinquency shall cause the potential borrower to be ineligible to
            receive a loan guarantee until the judgment is paid in full or
            otherwise satisfied or the delinquency is cured.

          All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be
          based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other sources of
          revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and
          maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and debt payment. Other sources of
          revenue or guarantors are particularly important in considering the
          feasibility of recreation-type loans. The lender is responsible for
          determining the credit quality and economic feasibility of the
          proposed loan and must address all elements of the credit quality in a
          written financial feasibility analysis which includes adequacy of
          equity, cash flow, security, history, and management capabilities.
          Financial feasibility reports must take into consideration any
          interest rate adjustment which may be instituted under the terms of
          the note. The lender&apos;s financial credit analysis may also serve
          as the feasibility analysis when sufficient evidence is included to
          determine economic feasibility as well as financial viability.

             The Agency loan approval official may exempt the lender from the
            requirement for an independent financial feasibility report (when
            requested by the borrower and the lender) provided the approval
            official determines that the financial feasibility analysis prepared
            by the borrower fairly represents the financial feasibility of the
            facility and the financial feasibility analysis contains an accurate
            projection of the usage, revenues, and expenses of the facility.

             Security must be of such a nature that repayment of the 
            <PRTPAGE P='737' />
            loan is reasonably ensured when considered with the integrity and
            ability of project management, soundness of the project, and the
            borrower&apos;s prospective earnings. The security may include, but
            is not limited to, the following: General obligation bonds, revenue
            bonds, pledge of taxes or assessments, assignment of facility
            revenue, land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, buildings,
            machinery, equipment, accounts receivable, contracts, cash, or other

            loan. The lender will not require compensating balances or

            exposure on the unguaranteed portion of the loan.

            consents, or subordinations to such property rights from holders of
            outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the
            construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility and to
            provide the required security. For example, when a site is for major
            structures for utility-type facilities (such as a gas distribution
            system) and the lender and borrower are able to obtain only a
            right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple
            title, such a title opinion must be requested.

            portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference
            or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan. The lender is
            responsible for taking all servicing actions that a prudent lender
            would perform in servicing a portfolio of loans that are not
            guaranteed. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, the
            collection of payments; obtaining compliance with the covenants and
            provisions in the note, loan agreement, security instrument, or any
            supplemental agreements; obtaining and analyzing financial
            statements; verifying the payment of taxes and insurance premiums;

            Agency of any violation of the loan agreement with the borrower
            within 30 days of such violation.

             The lender must notify the Agency when a borrower is 30 days past
            due on a payment, has not met its responsibilities of providing the
            required financial statements, or is otherwise in default. The
            lender will continue to keep the Agency informed on a bimonthly
            basis until such time as the loan is no longer in default. If a
            monetary default exceeds 60 days, the lender will arrange a meeting
            with the borrower to resolve the default. The lender will provide a
            summary of the meeting and any decisions or actions agreed upon.

             In considering servicing options, the prospects for providing a
            permanent cure without adversely affecting the risks to the Agency
            and the lender must be the paramount objective. Temporary curative
            actions (such as payment deferments or collateral subordination)
            must strengthen the loan and be in the best financial interest of
            the lender and the Agency. Some of these actions may require
            concurrence of the holder.

             The lender has the option to repurchase the loan from a holder
            within 30 days of written demand from the holder when the borrower
            is in default not less than 60 days 
            <PRTPAGE P='742' />
            on payment. The repurchase will be for an amount equal to the unpaid
            guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the
            lender&apos;s servicing fee. The guarantee does not cover the note
            interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days
            from the date of the demand letter to the lender. The holder will
            concurrently send a copy of the demand to the Agency. The lender
            will accept an assignment without recourse from the holder upon
            repurchase. The lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to
            facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve the problem, and permit
            the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. The lender will
            notify the holder and the Agency of its decision within 30 days of
            receipt of demand from the holder.

            fee) within 30 days after written demand to the Agency. The

            guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original
            demand letter. The lender shall not charge the Agency any servicing

             The lender must promptly provide the Agency with the information
            necessary for the Agency&apos;s determination of the appropriate
            amount due the holder upon the Agency&apos;s notification to the
            lender of the holder&apos;s demand for payment. This information
            must be certified by an authorized officer of the lender. Any

            will be approved. The Agency will notify both parties and such

             When the lender determines that repurchase of the guaranteed
            portion of the loan is necessary to service the loan, the holder
            must sell the guaranteed portion to the lender for the unpaid
            principal and interest balance (less the lender&apos;s servicing
            fee). The guarantee does not cover interest accruing after 90 days
            from the date the lender&apos;s or Agency&apos;s letter requesting
            the holder to tender its guaranteed portion. The lender must not
            repurchase from the holder for arbitrage purposes to further its own
            financial gain. Any repurchase must be made only after the lender
            obtains the Agency written approval. If the lender does not
            repurchase the portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its
            option, purchase such guaranteed portion for servicing purposes.

            rate on the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan
            on written agreement by all of the applicable parties. After such a
            permanent reduction, the Loan Note Guarantee will only cover losses
            of interest at the reduced interest rate. The Agency must be
            notified by the lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the
            change. When the Agency is a holder, it will concur only when it is
            demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and
            that the Government&apos;s financial interests are not adversely
            affected. Factors which will be considered in making such
            determination are the Government&apos;s cost of borrowing money and
            the project&apos;s enhancement of rural development. The monetary
            recovery must be greater than the liquidation recovery, and a
            financial feasibility analysis must show the project&apos;s
            continued viability.

          Liquidation will occur when the lender concludes that liquidation of
          the guaranteed loan is necessary because of default or third party
          actions that the borrower cannot, or will not, cure or eliminate
          within a reasonable period of time and the Agency concurs with the
          lender; or the Agency, at any time, independently concludes that
          liquidation is necessary. The lender will proceed as expeditiously as

          required by the security instruments.

             The Agency will liquidate at its option only when it is a holder

            liquidation efforts that will result in maximum recovery. When the

            against the proceeds derived from the sale of the collateral.

            credited as a deduction from the principal balance of the loan.

          Protective advances can only be added to the loan account for purposes
          of requirements to preserve the value of the security. Protective
          advances constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and
          must be secured by collateral to the same extent as principal and
          interest. Protective advances include, but are not limited to,
          advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard and
          flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral (including any other
          expenses necessary to protect the collateral). Attorney fees are not a
          protective advance.

            assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the
            transferor-debtor (including personal guarantor) is released from
            personal liability (as provided in paragraph (e) of this section),
            the lender (if holding the guaranteed portion) may file an estimated
            Report of Loss to recover their pro rata share of the actual loss at
            that time. Approved protective advances and accrued interest made
            during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption, if not assumed
            by the transferee, will be entered on the estimated Report of Loss.

             Mergers occur when one entity combines with another entity in such
            a way that the first entity ceases to exist as a separate entity
            while the other continues. In a consolidation, two or more entities
            combine to form a new, consolidated entity with the original entity
            ceasing to exist. Such transactions must be distinguished from
            transfers and assumptions in which a transferor will not necessarily
            go out of existence, and the transferee will not always take all the
            transferor&apos;s assets nor assume all the transferor&apos;s
            liabilities.

             Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the
            liquidation process. The liquidation costs must be submitted as a
            part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross
            proceeds received from the disposition of collateral unless the
            costs have been previously determined by the lender (with Agency
            concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances
            after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of
            liquidation costs, the lender will obtain the Agency&apos;s written
            concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No
            in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed.

             The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the

            the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be
            covered by the guarantee only to the date the Agency accepts this
            responsibility. When the liquidation is conducted by the lender,
            loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the extent
            of the guarantee to the date of final settlement provided the lender
            proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by the
            Agency.
