          The objective of the EWP Program is to assist sponsors, landowners,
          and operators in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff
          retardation and erosion prevention to relieve imminent hazards to life

          EWP Program technical and financial assistance may be made available
          to a qualified sponsor, or landowners when a floodplain easement is
          the selected alternative by the Secretary of Agriculture, upon a
          qualified sponsor 
          <PRTPAGE P='483' />
          or landowner&apos;s request when a Federal emergency is declared by
          the President or when a local emergency is declared by the NRCS State
          Conservationist. The EWP Program is designed for emergency recovery
          work, including the purchase of floodplain easements. Emergency
          watershed protection is authorized in the 50 States, the District of
          Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
          Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American
          Samoa.

             When planning emergency recovery practices, NRCS will emphasize
            measures that are the most economical and are to be accomplished by
            using the least damaging practical construction techniques and
            equipment that retain as much of the existing characteristics of the
            landscape and habitat as possible. Construction of emergency
            practices may include, but are not limited to, timing 
            <PRTPAGE P='486' />
            of the construction to avoid impacting fish spawning, clearing of
            right-of-ways, reshaping spoil, debris removal, use of
            bioengineering techniques, and revegetation of disturbed areas.
            Mitigation actions needed to offset potential adverse impacts of the
            EWP Program practices should be planned for installation before, or
            concurrent with, the installation of the EWP Program practices. In
            rare occurrences where mitigation cannot be installed concurrently,
            plans will require mitigation be accomplished as soon as practical.

             NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time
            to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be
            made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed
            necessary to protect important floodplain functions and values or
            other rights of the United States under the easement. The landowner
            will be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a
            result of the landowner&apos;s negligence or failure to comply with
            easement or agreement obligations.
