             Sponsor(s) are to make periodic and special inspections of
            installed project measures as provided in the plan of O&amp;M. For
            structural measures, inspections are to be made at least annually
            and after each major storm or occurrence of any unusual condition
            that might adversely affect the project measures. At the discretion
            of the State Conservationist, NRCS may assist sponsor(s) with their
            inspections. NRCS or land-administering agencies may make
            independent inspections at any time during the period covered by the
            O&amp;M agreement.
