          The failure by FNS to file an answer shall constitute a waiver of
          hearing. Upon such failure to file, the State agency shall file a
          proposed decision, along with a motion for adoption thereof, both of
          which shall be served upon FNS by the State agency. Within 10 days
          after service of such motion and proposed decision, FNS may file
          objections thereto. If the ALJ finds that meritorious objections have
          been filed, the State agency&apos;s motion shall be denied with
          supporting reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the ALJ
          shall issue an initial decision without further procedures or hearing.
          Copies of the initial decision or denial of the State agency&apos;s
          motion shall be served on each of the parties and shall be included as
          part of the official record. Where the decision as proposed by the
          State agency is adopted as the ALJ&apos;s initial decision, such
          decision of the ALJ shall become final and effective 30 days after

             A party may submit a written request for admission of the truth of
            any matters relevant to the appeal to any other party to the appeal.
            The time for submitting a written request for admission shall be set
            by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference. The number of admissions
            contained in a request submitted by a party shall not exceed
            twenty-five unless additional admissions are authorized by the ALJ.
            The matter is admitted unless, within 20 days after service thereof,
            or within such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ, the party
            to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the
            admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter
            signed by the party, counsel or designated representative. If
            objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer
            should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail why the
            answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. An
            answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a
            reason for the failure to admit or deny unless it is stated that
            reasonable inquiry has been made and that the information known or
            readily obtainable is insufficient to enable the party to admit or
            deny. A party who considers that a matter for which an admission has
            been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that
            ground alone, object to the request; the party may deny the matter
            or set forth reasons why the matter cannot be admitted or denied.

            Failure to request a hearing within the time specified shall

            shall be held at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.

            shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing

            such evidence considered a part of the hearing record without
            reopening the hearing, the Judicial Officer may direct that the
            hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any

             If the ALJ orders consolidation, the issues consolidated will be
            considered first. If a hearing has been requested by any of the
            parties that have had issues consolidated, arguments on the
            consolidated issues will be heard before arguments on dissimilar
            issues. The ALJ will take the information into consideration along
            with arguments on other issues in preparing initial decisions for QC
            appeals in which some issues have been consolidated.

            claim of less than $50,000 for a food stamp QC error rate in excess
            of the tolerance level. A State agency must file a written notice of
            appeal, in accordance with this section, within 10 days of receipt
            of the bill for collection from FNS for a QC claim of less than
            $50,000. The State agency may request an extension to the 10-day
            filing requirement in accordance with
