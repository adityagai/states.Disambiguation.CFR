            under which the property is subject to forfeiture. The notice shall
            state that any person desiring to claim the property must file a
            claim and a bond in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this
            section, and shall state that if a proper claim and bond are not
            received by the specified office within the time prescribed by such

             Upon issuance of the notice of proposed forfeiture, any person
            claiming ownership of or other interest in the seized property may
            file with the office specified in the notice a claim to the property
            and a bond in the amount of $250, with sureties to be approved by
            the Deputy Administrator, conditioned that in case of condemnation
            of the articles so claimed, the obligor shall pay all the costs and
            expenses of the proceedings to obtain such condemnation. Any claim
            and bond must be received in such office within 20 days after
            posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture, and shall state
            claimant&apos;s interest in the property. The Deputy Administrator
            may extend the 20 day period with an appropriate statement on the
            posted notice of proposed forfeiture, if necessary, to allow a
            person deemed to have an interest in the property at least 10 days
            to file such a claim and bond after receipt of a notice of proposed
            forfeiture. The bond shall be on a U.S. Customs Form 4615 or on a

            shall be endorsed on the bond a list or schedule in substantially

            petitioner&apos;s attorney at law.

             Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall decide
            whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy
            Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the
            petitioner, as well as any other available information relating to
            the matter, and may require that testimony be taken concerning the
            petition.

             If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was incurred
            without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of
            the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such
            mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of
            the forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may
            remit or mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems
            reasonable and just. However, remission or mitigation will not be
            made if such action would frustrate the purposes of the Act or
            Convention. As an example, this section does not allow remission or
            mitigation with respect to terrestrial plants that are without
            documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.

             The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing

            state the 
            <PRTPAGE P='502' />
            reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the
            petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no
            supplemental petition shall be considered unless it is received
            within 60 days from the date of the Deputy Administrator&apos;s
            notification concerning the original petition. The Deputy
            Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing concerning the
            action taken in response to the supplemental petition, and shall
            state the reasons therefor.

          If, at the conclusion of proceedings, seized property is to be
          returned to the person determined to be the owner or agent thereof,
          the Deputy Administrator shall issue a letter or other document to the
          person determined to be owner or agent thereof authorizing its return.
          This letter shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or
          certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall identify the
          person determined to be the owner or agent, the seized property, and
          if appropriate, the bailee of the seized property. It shall also
          provide that upon presentation of the letter or other document and
          proper identification, and the signing of a receipt provided by Plant
          Protection and Quarantine, the seized property is authorized to be
