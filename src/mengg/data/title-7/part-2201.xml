             With respect to applications for a Loan of $15 million or more, the
            Applicant is required to obtain and submit to the Board a
            preliminary credit rating opinion letter on the proposed transaction
            at the time of application, prepared by a nationally recognized
            statistical rating organization (rating agency) approved by the
            Board. This preliminary credit rating opinion shall be based on the
            financing structure proposed by the Applicant for the Project absent
            the Federal Guarantee, without regard to recovery expectations. The
            Board will utilize this preliminary credit assessment to assist in
            evaluating the creditworthiness of the proposed transaction and
            determining whether it provides a reasonable assurance of repayment.
            In addition, applicants for loans less than $15 million that have a
            credit rating shall provide that credit rating to the Board. The
            Board will utilize this preliminary credit assessment (for loans
            over $15 million) or an existing credit rating (for loans less than
            $15 million) to assist in evaluating the creditworthiness of the
            proposed transaction and determining whether it provides a
            reasonable assurance of repayment. The Board may approve a Guarantee
            over $15 million only if it receives a final 
            <PRTPAGE P='44' />
            credit rating opinion letter from the rating agency on the Loan that
            is in form and substance acceptable to the Board.

             The Board shall charge each Applicant for a Guarantee under the

            to cover the costs of making necessary determinations and findings
            with respect to an application for a Guarantee under the Program.
            The amount of the fee is $10,000 for Loans of $1 million up to $50
            million, $15,000 for Loans of $50 million up to $100 million,
            $30,000 for Loans of $100 million up to $500 million, and $40,000

            enter into an agreement providing for the payment of the Guarantee

            incurred by the Government as a result of granting Guarantees under

            of the Board to minimize the cost of the Program to the Government.
            The Board will estimate the risk posed by the guaranteed Loans to
            the funds appropriated for the costs of the Guarantees under the
            Program and operate the Program accordingly.
