             Under the MAP, CCC may provide grants to eligible U.S. entities to
            conduct certain marketing and promotion activities aimed at
            developing, maintaining, or expanding commercial export markets for
            U.S. agricultural commodities and products. MAP Participants may
            receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities.
            While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable
            activities may also take place in the United States. CCC expects all
            activities that occur in the United States for which MAP
            reimbursement is sought to develop, maintain, or expand the
            commercial export market for the relevant U.S. agricultural
            commodity in accordance with the MAP Participant&apos;s approved MAP
            program. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade
            organizations, CCC gives priority to organizations that have the
            broadest producer representation and affiliated industry
            participation of the commodity being promoted.

             CCC&apos;s policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP
            agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant
            agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue
            advantage. CCC also endeavors to enter into MAP agreements covering
            a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The MAP is
            administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS)
            acting on behalf of CCC.

            applicant&apos;s prior overall marketing budget in the MAP program
            from year-to-year, variations in promotional strategies within a
            country, and new markets.

             An evaluation plan describing the applicant&apos;s goals and the
            applicant&apos;s plans for monitoring and evaluating performance
            towards achieving these goals. This evaluation plan should set forth
            specific goals and benchmarks set at regular intervals to be used to
            identify results against identified constraints and opportunities
            and to measure progress made in the target market. Evaluation of a
            proposed MAP program&apos;s effectiveness will depend on a clear
            statement by the applicant of goals, method of achievement, and
            expected results of programming at regular intervals. The overall
            goal of the MAP and of individual Participants&apos; programming is
            to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the
            absence of MAP funding. A MAP Participant may modify and resubmit
            this plan for re-approval at any time during the program year.

             General. CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, approve
            those applications that it considers to present the best opportunity
            for developing, maintaining, or expanding export markets for U.S.
            agricultural commodities. The selection process, by its nature,
            involves the exercise of judgment. CCC&apos;s choice of Participants
            and proposed promotion projects requires that it consider and weigh
            a number of factors, some of which cannot be mathematically
            measured—e.g., market opportunity, market strategy, and management
            capability. CCC may require that an applicant participate in the MAP
            through another MAP Participant or applicant.

            “Made in America”, or product of, grown in or made in any state or
            territory of the United States of America spelled out in its
            entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance
            by CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously
            displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of
            the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to
            the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of

             inch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter
            “o”. The use of the above terms as a descriptor or in the name of
            the product (e.g., Texas style chili, Bob&apos;s American Pizza)
            does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases “product of
            ”, “grown in” or “made in” are encouraged, but not required. A MAP
            Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a
            case-by-case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and
            include justification satisfactory to CCC that this labeling
            requirement would hinder a MAP Participant&apos;s promotional
            efforts. CCC will determine, on a case by case basis, whether
            sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the
            labeling requirement. In addition, CCC may temporarily waive this
            requirement where CCC has determined that such labeling will likely
            harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be
            announced to MAP Participants via a MAP notice issued on FAS&apos;

            promotion in a single country for more than 5 years. Such 5 years do

            to the 1994 program year or the brand participant&apos;s first
            program year, whichever is later. In limited circumstances, CCC may
            waive the 5 year limitation if CCC determines that further
            assistance is in the best interests of the MAP. CCC 
            <PRTPAGE P='893' />
            shall, at its discretion, decide whether a reincorporated or
            re-organized entity is substantially similar to the pre-existing
            entity for purposes of applying this 5-year rule. Brand
            participants&apos; participation in certain international trade
            shows in foreign countries will not be considered when determining
            such brand participants&apos; time in country for purposes of the 5
            year graduation requirement. Such shows must meet two requirements:
            They are food or agricultural shows, with no less than 30% of
            exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, and they are
            international shows, meaning they target buyers, distributors and
            the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of
            each show&apos;s visitors are from countries other than the host
            country. CCC will compile a list of international trade shows that
            CCC exempts from the graduation requirement and such list will be
            announced to MAP Participants via a MAP notice issued on FAS&apos;
            Web site.

             A MAP Participant must use its own funds and may not use MAP
            program funds to pay any administrative costs of the MAP
            Participant&apos;s U.S. office(s), including legal fees, except as
            set forth in this subpart. Where the MAP Participant uses its own
            funds to pay for administrative costs, such costs may be counted in
            calculating the amount of contributions the MAP Participant
            contributes to MAP generic or brand promotion programs.

            will be employed as a country director or regional director by

             Where a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as
            a country director, the MAP Participant may request approval for a
            “Supergrade I” salary level, equivalent to a grade increase over the
            existing top grade of the FSN salary plan. The supergrade and its
            step increases are calculated as the percentage difference between
            the second highest and the highest grade in the FSN salary plan,
            with that percentage applied to each of the steps in the top grade.
            Where the non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed
            as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/or
            offices in more than one country, the MAP Participant may request
            approval for a “Supergrade II” salary level, which is calculated
            relative to a “Supergrade I” in the same way the latter is
            calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.

             A MAP Participant for generic promotion activities may request an
            advance of MAP funds from CCC, provided the MAP Participant meets
            the criteria for advance payments set forth in the applicable parts
            of this title (e.g., 
            <aref type='CFR'>
              7 CFR Parts 
              <subref title='7' part='3015' tq='N'>

            ). CCC will not approve any request for an advance submitted later
            than 3 months after the end of a MAP Participant&apos;s program
            year. At any given time, total payments advanced shall not exceed 40
            percent of a MAP Participant&apos;s approved generic activity budget
            for the program year. CCC will not advance funds to a MAP
            Participant for brand promotion activities. When approving a request
            for an advance, CCC may require the MAP Participant to carry
            adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is
            considered to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the
            MAP. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation
            will depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, the
            Participant&apos;s history of performance in MAP; the
            Participant&apos;s perceived financial stability and resources; and
            any other factors presented in the particular situation that may
            reflect on the Participant&apos;s responsibility or the riskiness of
            its activities.

            programs, including the MAP. Evaluation of the MAP&apos;s
            effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by Participants of
            goals to be met within a specified time, schedule of measurable
            milestones for gauging success, plan for achievement, and assessment
            of results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of
            the MAP and of individual Participants&apos; programming is to
            achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the
            absence of MAP funding. A MAP Participant that can demonstrate such
            sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the
            Participant&apos;s control, will have met the overall objective of
            the GPRA and the need for evaluation.

             Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide
            either a written compliance report or a letter to the MAP
            Participant. USDA staff will issue a compliance report if it appears
            that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from that Participant
            and/or it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of
            the terms or conditions of the program agreement, approval letter,
            or the applicable laws and regulations. The compliance report will
            explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant.
            Within 30 days of the date of the compliance report, the MAP
            Participant shall repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a
            check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim.
            The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless
            otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a MAP Participant
            notifies CCC within 30 days of the date of the compliance report
            that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to

            , the amount owed to CCC by the MAP Participant is not due until the
            appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final
            determination as to the amount owed. In the absence of any finding
            of funds due to CCC or other non-compliance, CCC will issue a letter
            to the MAP Participant. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC
            determines that further review is needed in order to ensure
            compliance with the requirements of MAP, CCC may require the
            Participant to contract for an independent audit.

            from the Participant. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of
            funds from the Participant in the written notice. The MAP
            Participant shall within 30 days of the date of the notice repay CCC
            the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by

          A MAP Participant&apos;s required contribution will be specified in
          the approval letter. If the MAP Participant&apos;s required
          contribution is specified as a dollar amount and the MAP Participant
          does not make the required contribution, the MAP Participant shall pay
          to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually
          contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the
          MAP Participant&apos;s required contribution is specified as a
          percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the MAP Participant
          may either return to CCC the amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to
          increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or
          pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually
          contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual
          contribution percentage to the required level. A MAP Participant shall
          remit such payment within six months after the end of its program
          year. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars,
          unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

            programs annually. The fraud prevention program shall, at a minimum,

            participant through the MAP Participant on claims that the MAP

            program, however, will not be liable to reimburse CCC for MAP funds
            paid on such claims if the claims were based on misrepresentations
