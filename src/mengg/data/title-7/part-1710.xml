           (DSM) means the deliberate planning and/or implementation of
          activities to influence consumer use of electricity provided by a
          distribution borrower to produce beneficial modifications to the
          system load profile. Beneficial modifications to the system load
          profile ordinarily improve load factor or otherwise help in utilizing
          electric system resources to best advantage consistent with acceptable
          standards of service and lowest system cost. Load profile
          modifications are characterized as peak clipping, valley filling, load
          shifting, strategic conservation, strategic load growth, and flexible
          load profile. (See, for example, publications of the Electric Power
          Research Institute (EPRI), 3412 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304,
          especially “Demand-Side Management Glossary” EPRI TR-101158, Project

          Administrator may waive or reduce any requirement imposed by this part
          or other RUS regulations on an electric borrower, or a lender whose
          loan is guaranteed by RUS, if the Administrator determines that
          imposition of the requirement would adversely affect the

            or other developments that threaten loan feasibility or security,
            RUS may require the borrower to obtain a reaffirmation of the
            project and its financing from the state authority before any
            additional loan funds are advanced.

             If, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the amount
            authorized for lending for municipal rate loans, hardship rate
            loans, and loan guarantees in a fiscal year is substantially less
            than the total amount eligible for RUS financing, RUS may limit the
            size of all loans of that type approved during the fiscal year.
            Depending on the amount of the shortfall between the amount
            authorized for lending and the loan application inventory on hand
            for each type of loan, RUS may either reduce the amount on an equal
            proportion basis for all applicants for that type of loan based on
            the amount of funds for which the applicant is eligible, or may
            shorten the loan period for which funding will be approved to less
            than the maximum of 4 years. All applications for the same type of
            loan approved during a fiscal year will be treated in the same
            manner, except that RUS will not limit funding to any borrower
            requesting an RUS loan or loan guarantee of $1 million or less.

             If RUS limits the amount of loan funds approved for borrowers, the
            Administrator shall notify all electric borrowers early in the
            fiscal year of the manner in which funding will be limited. The
            portion of the loan application that is not funded during that
            fiscal year may, at the borrower&apos;s option, be treated as a
            second loan application received by RUS at a later date. This date
            will be determined by RUS in the same manner for all affected loans
            and will be based on the availability of loan funds. The second loan
            application shall be considered complete except that the borrower
            must submit a certification from a duly authorized corporate
            official stating that funds are still needed for loan purposes
            specified in the original application and must notify RUS of any

            , applicants for a municipal rate loan will be required to obtain a
            portion of their loan funds from a supplemental source without an
            RUS guarantee, in the amounts set forth in paragraph (c) of this
            section. RUS will normally grant a lien accommodation to the
            supplemental lender. RUS does not require supplemental financing in
            conjunction with an RUS guaranteed loan. However, if a borrower
            elects to obtain supplemental financing in conjunction with a
            guaranteed loan, the granting of RUS&apos;s loan guarantee may be
            conditioned on the borrower&apos;s obtaining supplemental financing.

             The terms and conditions of supplemental financing and any security
            offered to the supplemental lender are subject to RUS approval.
            Generally, supplemental loans must have the same final maturity and
            be amortized in the same manner as RUS loans made concurrently.
            Borrowers may elect to repay the loans either in substantially equal
            periodic installments covering interest and principal, or in
            periodic installments that include interest and level amortization
            of principal.

            compliant on or before December 31, 1999. Year 2000 compliant means

            intangible personal property and any property acquired after the

            borrower and a trustee satisfactory to the Administrator, together
            with such security documents as RUS may deem necessary in a

            utilities engaged in private market financing, in lieu of a mortgage

            use of an indenture will be by mutual agreement of the borrower and

             In the case of loans that include the financing of electric

            financed system (such as generation and transmission facilities

            facilities, furnish adequate assurance, in the form of contractual
            or other security arrangements, that the system will be operated on
            an efficient and continuous basis. Satisfactory evidence must also
            be provided that the non-RUS financed system is financially sound

            financial reports, annual reports, Security and Exchange Commission

            into effect or taking action to obtain regulatory authority approval

             RUS is authorized to make loans and loan guarantees with a final
            maturity of up to 35 years. The borrower may elect a repayment
            period for a loan not longer than the expected useful life of the
            facilities, not to exceed 35 years. Most of the electric facilities
            financed by RUS have a long useful life, often approximating 35
            years. Some facilities, such as load management equipment and
            Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition equipment, have a much
            shorter useful life due, in part, to obsolescence. Operating loans
            to finance working capital required for the initial operation of a
            new system are a separate class of loans and usually have a final
            maturity of less than 10 years.

             Loans made or guaranteed by RUS for facilities owned by the
            borrower generally must be repaid with interest within a period, up
            to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the
            facilities financed. The expected useful life shall be based on the
            weighted average of the useful lives that the borrower proposes for
            the facilities financed by the loan, provided that the proposed
            useful lives are deemed appropriate by RUS. RUS Form 740c, Cost
            Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, submitted as part
            of the loan application must include, as a note, either a statement
            certifying that at least 90 percent of the loan funds are for
            facilities that have a useful life of 33 years or longer, or a
            schedule showing the costs and useful life of those facilities with
            a useful life of less than 33 years. If the useful life
            determination proposed by the borrower is not deemed appropriate by
            RUS, RUS will base expected useful life on an independent
            evaluation, the manufacturer&apos;s estimated useful-life or RUS

            additions required to provide reliable service to meet the
            forecasted loads. Subpart E of this part contains the information to
            be included in a load forecast and when an approved load forecast is
            required.

          This subpart contains RUS policies for the preparation, review,
          approval and use of load forecasts and load forecast work plans. A
          load forecast is a thorough study of a borrower&apos;s electric loads
          and the factors that affect those loads in order to estimate, as
          accurately as practicable, the borrower&apos;s future requirements for
          energy and capacity. The load forecast of a power supply borrower
          includes and integrates the load forecasts of its member systems. An
          approved load forecast, if required by this subpart, is one of the
          primary documents that a borrower is required to submit to support a
          loan application.

            All data must be in a tabular form that can be transferred
            electronically to RUS computer software applications. RUS will
            evaluate borrower load forecasts for readability, understanding,
            filing, and electronic access. If a borrower&apos;s load forecast is
            submitted in a format that is not readily usable by RUS or is
            incomplete, RUS will require the borrower to submit the load
            forecast in a format acceptable to RUS.

             If a borrower relies on an approved load forecast or an update of
            an approved load forecast as loan support, the borrower must
            demonstrate that the approved load forecast and the other primary
            support documentation for the loan were reconciled. For example,
            both the load forecast and the financial forecast require input
            assumptions for wholesale power costs, distribution costs, other
            systems costs, average revenue per kWh, and inflation. Also, a
            borrower&apos;s engineering planning documents, such as the
            construction work plan, incorporate consumer and usage per consumer
            projections from the load forecast to develop system design
            criteria. The assumptions and data common to all the documents must
            be consistent.

             An approved load forecast work plan establishes the process for the
            preparation and maintenance of a comprehensive database for the
            development of the borrower&apos;s load forecast, and load forecast
            updates. The approved load forecast work plan is intended to develop
            and maintain a process that will result in load forecasts that will
            meet the borrowers&apos; own needs and the requirements of this
            subpart. An approved work plan represents a commitment by a power
            supply borrower and its members, or by a large unaffiliated

             An ongoing, integrated planning system is needed by borrowers to
            determine their short-term and long-term needs for plant additions,
            improvements, replacements, and retirements. The primary components
            of the system consist of long-range engineering plans, construction
            work plans (CWPs), CWP amendments, and special engineering and cost
            studies. Long range engineering plans identify plant investments
            required over a period of 10 years or more. CWPs specify and
            document plant requirements for the short-term, usually 2 to 3
            years, and special engineering and cost studies are used to support
            CWPs and to identify and document requirements for specific items or
            purposes, such as load management equipment, System Control and Data
            Acquisition equipment, sectionalizing investments, and additions

             Generally, all borrowers are required to maintain up-to-date long
            range engineering plans approved by their boards of directors.
            Current CWPs approved by the borrower&apos;s board must also be
            developed and maintained for distribution and transmission
            facilities and for improvements and replacements of generation
            facilities. All such distribution, transmission or generation
            facilities must be included in the respective CWPs regardless of the
            source of financing.

            for an orderly transition from the existing system to the system
            required 10 or more years in the future. The planned future system

            environmentally acceptable manner, and it should ensure that planned

             Applications for a loan or loan guarantee from RUS (new loans or
            budget reclassifications) must be supported by a current CWP
            approved by both the borrower&apos;s board of directors and RUS. RUS
            approval of these plans relates only to the facilities, equipment,
            and other purposes to be financed by RUS, and means that the plans
            provide an adequate basis from a planning and engineering standpoint
            to support RUS financing. RUS approval of the plans does not mean
            that RUS approves of the facilities, equipment, or other purposes
            for which the borrower is not seeking RUS financing. If RUS
            disagrees with a borrower&apos;s estimate of the cost of one or more
            facilities for which RUS financing is sought, RUS may adjust the
            estimate after consulting with the borrower and explaining the
            reasons for the adjustment.

            subpart. For example, if a borrower&apos;s load is forecast to
            remain constant or decline during the planning period, RUS may waive
            those portions of the plans that relate to load growth.

             If a borrower already owns and operates the types of facilities

            in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as well as for the construction
            of transmission facilities by a distribution borrower, will be
            considered and evaluated by RUS in terms of whether the proposed
            facilities constitute an effective and economical means of meeting
            the power requirements of the consumers. A borrower shall contact
            RUS as soon as practicable in order for RUS to review information
            submitted by the borrower and advise the borrower, in writing,
            whether there is a need for the borrower to investigate and seek

            information provided by the borrower or otherwise available, whether
            there is a need to investigate alternative sources of power or
            whether RUS will require information or other methods of determining

            needed, the borrower would incur delays and costs in pursuing an
            RFP, or that an RFP is not likely to produce new alternatives to the
            project.

            associated interest, projected loads, projected revenues, and the
            probable future competitiveness of the borrower. When RUS determines
            that a sensitivity analysis is necessary for distribution borrowers,
            the variables to be tested will be determined by the General Field
            Representative in consultation with the borrower and the regional
            office. The regional office will consult with the Power Supply
            Division in the case of generation projects for distribution
            borrowers. For power supply borrowers, the variables to be tested
            will be determined by the borrower and the Power Supply Division.

             A new mortgage will be required if this is a borrower&apos;s first

            mortgage supplement will be required if there has been a material
            change to the real property owned by the borrower since the most
            recent RUS loan, loan guarantee, or lien accommodation, if the
            requested loan would cause the borrower to exceed its previously
            authorized debt limit, or if RUS otherwise determines it necessary.
            If there has been no material change to the real property owned by
            the borrower since the most recent RUS loan or loan guarantee, the
            borrower must submit an opinion of its counsel to that effect. If a
            new or restated mortgage or a mortgage supplement is required, the
