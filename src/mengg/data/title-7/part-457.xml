          <P>
            (iii) Once the policy is terminated, it cannot be reinstated for the

            extenuating circumstances is not grounds for reinstatement in the

          <P>
            (i) Repay the delinquent debt in full;
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Execute a written payment agreement and make payments in
            accordance with the agreement (We will not enter into a written

            payment agreement with you if you have previously failed to make a

          <P>
            (iii) File a petition to have your debts discharged in bankruptcy
            (Dismissal of the bankruptcy petition before discharge will
            terminate all policies in effect retroactive to the date your policy
            would have been terminated in accordance with

          </P>
          <P>
            (4) After you become eligible for crop insurance, if you want to
            obtain coverage for your crops, you must submit a new application on
            or before the sales closing date for the crop (Since applications
            for crop insurance cannot be accepted after the sales closing date,
            if you make any payment after the sales closing date, you cannot
            apply for insurance until the next crop year).
          </P>
          <P>
            (5) For example, for the 2011 crop year, if crop A, with a
            termination date of October 31, 2010, and crop B, with a termination
            date of March 15, 2011, are insured and you do not pay the premium
            for crop A by the termination date, you are ineligible for crop
            insurance as of October 31, 2010, and crop A&apos;s policy is
            terminated as of that date. Crop B&apos;s policy does not terminate
            until March 15, 2011, and an indemnity for the 2010 crop year may
            still be owed. If you enter into a written payment agreement on
            September 25, 2011, the earliest date by which you can obtain crop
            insurance for crop A is to apply for crop insurance by the October
            31, 2011, sales closing date and for crop B is to apply for crop
            insurance by the March 15, 2012, sales closing date. If you fail to
            make a payment that was scheduled to be made on April 1, 2012, your
            policy will terminate as of October 31, 2011, for crop A, and March
            15, 2012, for crop B, and no indemnity, prevented planting payment
            or replant payment will be due for that crop year for either crop.
            You will not be eligible to apply for crop insurance for any crop
            until after the amounts owed are paid in full or you file a petition
            to discharge the debt in bankruptcy.
          </P>

            (6) If you are determined to be ineligible under

            coverage or percentage of available price election or projected
            price if:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) The applicable Crop Provisions allow you the option to
            separately insure individual crop types or varieties. In this case,
            each individual type or variety insured by you will be subject to
            separate administrative fees. For example, if two grape varieties in
            California are insured under the Catastrophic Risk Protection
            Endorsement and two varieties are insured under an additional
            coverage policy, a separate administrative fee will be charged for
            each of the four varieties; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) You have additional coverage for the crop in the county and the
            acreage has been designated as “high-risk” by FCIC. In such case,
            you will be able to exclude coverage for the high-risk land under
            the additional coverage policy and insure such acreage under a
            separate Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, provided the
            Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is obtained from the same
            insurance provider from which the additional coverage was obtained.
            If you have revenue protection and exclude high-risk land, the
            catastrophic risk protection coverage will be yield protection only
            for the excluded high-risk land.
          </P>

            coverage level or elect the harvest price exclusion by giving
            written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the
            insured crop;
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) Your projected price and harvest price will be 100 percent of
            the projected price and harvest price issued by FCIC;
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) If the harvest price exclusion is:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Not elected, your projected price is used to initially determine
            the revenue protection guarantee (per acre), and if the harvest
            price is greater than the projected price, the revenue protection
            guarantee (per acre) will be recomputed using your harvest price; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Elected, your projected price is used to compute your revenue
            protection guarantee (per acre);
          </P>
          <P>
            (4) Your projected price is used to calculate your premium, any
            replant payment, and any prevented planting payment; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (5) If the projected price or harvest price cannot be calculated for
            the current crop year under the provisions contained in the
            Commodity Exchange Price Provisions:
          </P>

            (i) For the projected price:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) Revenue protection will not be provided and you will
            automatically be covered under the yield protection plan of
            insurance for the current crop year unless you cancel your coverage
            by the cancellation date or change your plan of insurance by the
            sales closing date;
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) Notice will be provided on RMA&apos;s Web site by the date

            definition contained in the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (D) Your coverage will automatically revert to revenue protection
            for the next crop year that revenue protection is available unless
            you cancel your coverage by the cancellation date or change your
            coverage by the sales closing date; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) For the harvest price:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) Revenue protection will continue to be available; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) The harvest price will be determined and announced by FCIC.

            (d) With respect to yield protection, if available for the crop:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) You may change to another plan of insurance and change your
            percentage of price and your coverage level by giving written notice
            to us not later than the sales closing date for the insured crop;
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) The percentage of the projected price selected by you multiplied
            by the projected price issued by FCIC is your projected price that
            is used to compute the value of your production guarantee (per acre)
            and the value of the production to count; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) Since the projected price may change each year, if you do not
            select a new percentage of the projected price on or before the
            sales closing date, we will assign a percentage which bears the same
            relationship to the percentage that was in effect for the preceding
            year (

            (1) In addition to the price election or amount of insurance
            available on the contract change date, we may provide an additional
            price election or amount of insurance no later than 15 days prior to
            the sales closing date.
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) You must select the additional price election or amount of
            insurance on or before the sales closing date for the insured crop.
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) These additional price elections or amounts of insurance will
            not be less than those available on the contract change date.
          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) If you elect the additional price election or amount of
            insurance, any claim settlement and amount of premium will be based
            on your additional price election or amount of insurance.
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) You may change to another plan of insurance or change your
            coverage level, amount of insurance or percentage of the price
            election, as applicable, for the following crop year by giving
            written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the
            insured crop.
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) Your amount of insurance will be the amount of insurance issued
            by FCIC multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elected.
            Your price election will be the price election issued by FCIC
            multiplied by the percentage of price you elected.
          </P>
          <P>
            (4) Since the amount of insurance or price election may change each
            year, if you do not select a new amount of insurance or percentage
            of the price election on or before the sales closing date, we will
            assign an amount of insurance or percentage of the price election
            which bears the same relationship to the amount of insurance or
            percentage of the price election that was in effect for the
            preceding year (

            election for the current crop year, we will assign 100 percent of
            the price election for the current crop year).

            (f) You must report all production of the crop (insured and
            uninsured) to us for the previous crop year by the earlier of the

            (1) If you do not provide the required production report, we will
            assign a yield for the previous crop year. The yield assigned by us
            will not be more than 75 percent of the yield used by us to
            determine your coverage for the previous crop year. The production
            report or assigned yield will be used to compute your approved yield
            for the purpose of determining your coverage for the current crop
            year.

            (2) If you have filed a claim for any crop year, the documents
            signed by you which state the amount of production used to complete
            the claim for indemnity will be the production report for that year
            unless otherwise specified by FCIC.

          <P>
            (3) Production and acreage for the prior crop year must be reported
            for each proposed optional unit by the production reporting date. If
            you do not provide the information stated above, the optional units
            will be combined into the basic unit.

            field that remains unharvested after the remainder of the crop
            within the field has been destroyed or put to another use will not
            be used to establish your actual yield unless representative samples
            are required to be left by you in accordance with the Crop

            (a) Any act by any person that affects the yield, quality or price

          <P>
            (c) Water that is contained by or within structures that are
            designed to contain a specific amount of water, such as dams, locks
            or reservoir projects, etc., on any acreage when such water stays
            within the designed limits (For example, a dam is designed to
            contain water to an elevation of 1,200 feet but you plant a crop on
            acreage at an elevation of 1,100 feet. A storm causes the water
            behind the dam to rise to an elevation of 1,200 feet. Under such
            circumstances, the resulting damage would not be caused by an
            insurable cause of loss. However, if you planted on acreage that was
            above 1,200 feet elevation, any damage caused by water that exceeded
            that elevation would be caused by an insurable cause of loss);

          </P>
          <P>
            (i) If you report damage less than 15 days before the time you will
            begin harvest or during harvest of the damaged unit; or

          <P>
            (3) Unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or Special

          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Request an extension in writing by such date and we agree to
            such request (Extensions will only be granted if the amount of the
            loss can not be determined within such time period because the
            information needed to determine the amount of the loss is not
            available); or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Have harvested farm-stored grain production and elect, in
            writing, to delay measurement of your farm-stored production and
            settlement of any potential associated claim for indemnity
            (Extensions will be granted for this purpose up to 180 days after
            the end of the insurance period).
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) For policies that require APH, if such extension continues
            beyond the date you are required to submit your production report,
            you will be assigned the previous year&apos;s approved yield as a
            temporary yield in accordance with applicable procedures.
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) Any extension does not extend any date specified in the policy
            by which premiums, administrative fees, or other debts owed must be
            paid.
          </P>
          <P>
            (C) Damage that occurs after the end of the insurance period (for
            example, while the harvested crop production is in storage) is not
            covered; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) Failure to timely submit a claim or provide the required
            information necessary to determine the amount of the claim will
            result in no indemnity, prevented planting payment or replant
            payment:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Even though no indemnity or replant payment is due, you will
            still be required to pay the premium due under the policy for the
            unit; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Failure to timely submit a prevented planting claim will result
            in no prevented planting coverage and no premium will be due.
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) You must submit a claim not later than:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) For policies other than revenue protection, 60 days after the
            date the insurance period ends for all acreage in the unit (When
            there is acreage in the unit where the insurance period ended on
            different dates, it is the last date the insurance period ends on
            the unit. For example, if a unit has corn acreage that was put to
            another use on July 15 and corn acreage where harvest was completed
            on September 30, the claim must be submitted not later than 60 days
            after September 30); or
          </P>

            (ii) For revenue protection, the later of:

          <P>
            (A) 60 days after the last date the harvest price is released for
            any crop in the unit; or

            (4) To receive any indemnity (or receive the rest of an indemnity in
            the case of acreage that is planted to a second crop), prevented
            planting payment or replant payment, you must, if applicable:

            plant cotton on the same 10 acres, you must provide records of the
            wheat and cotton production on the 10 acres separate from any other
            wheat and cotton production that may be planted in the same unit).
            If you fail to provide separate records for such acreage, we will
            allocate the production of each crop to the acreage in proportion to

          <P>
            (1) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre
            planted as specified in this subsection will be determined by
            multiplying the production guarantee or amount of insurance that is
            provided for acreage of the insured crop that is timely planted by
            the prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or

            the time:

          <P>
            (i) You lease the acreage (except acreage you leased the previous

            (ii) You buy the acreage;

          <P>
            (iii) The acreage is released from a USDA program which prohibits
            harvest of a crop;

            (g) If you purchased an additional coverage policy for a crop, and
            you executed a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option that separately
            insures acreage which has been designated as “high-risk” land by
            FCIC under a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for that crop,
            the maximum number of acres eligible for a prevented planting
            payment will be limited for each policy as specified in

            (h) If you are prevented from planting a crop for which you do not
            have an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage, as
            determined in accordance with

            year for which you have remaining eligible prevented planting
            acreage.
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) The crop first used for this purpose will be the insured crop
            that would have a prevented planting payment most similar to the
            payment for the crop that was prevented from being planted.
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) If there are still insufficient eligible prevented planting
            acres, the next crop used will be the insured crop that would have
            the next closest prevented planting payment.
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) In the event payment amounts based on other crops are an equal
            amount above and below the payment amount for the crop that was
            prevented from being planted, eligible acres for the crop with the
            higher payment amount will be used first.
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) The prevented planting payment and premium will be based on:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) The crop that was prevented from being planted if the insured
            crop with remaining eligible acreage would have resulted in a higher
            prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop
            that was prevented from being planted; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) The crop from which eligible acres are being used if the
            insured crop with remaining eligible acreage will result in a lower
            prevented planting payment than would have been paid for the crop
            that was prevented from being planted.
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) For example, assume you were prevented from planting 200 acres
            of corn and you have 100 acres eligible for a corn prevented
            planting guarantee that would result in a payment of $40 per acre.
            You also had 50 acres of potato eligibility that would result in a
            $100 per acre payment and 90 acres of grain sorghum eligibility that
            would result in a $30 per acre payment. Your prevented planting
            coverage will be based on 100 acres of corn ($40 per acre), 90 acres
            of grain sorghum ($30 per acre), and an additional 10 acres of corn
            (using potato eligible acres and paid as corn at $40 per acre). Your
            prevented planting payment would be $7,100 ($4,000 + $2,700 + $400).
          </P>
          <P>
            (4) Prevented planting coverage will be allowed as specified in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 17(h)
            </aref>

            the policy provisions, except for having an adequate base of
            eligible prevented planting acreage. Payment may be made based on
            crops other than those that were prevented from being planted even
            though other policy provisions, including but not limited to,
            processor contract and rotation requirements, have not been met for
            the crop whose eligible acres are being used.

            (1) Multiplying the prevented planting coverage level percentage you

            (ii) The amount determined by multiplying the production guarantee
            (per acre) for timely planted acreage of the insured crop (or type,

             if a portion of your acreage is located where sections are the
            basis for optional units and another portion of your acreage is
            located where FSA farm serial numbers are the basis for optional
            units, you may qualify for an enterprise unit based on a combination
            of these two parcels);
          </P>
          <P>
            (E) One section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number that
            contains at least 660 planted acres of the insured crop. You may
            qualify under this paragraph based only on the type of parcel that
            is utilized to establish optional units where your insured acreage
            is located (
            <E T='03'>
              e.g.,
            </E>
             if having two or more sections is the basis for optional units
            where the insured acreage is located, you may qualify for an
            enterprise unit if you have at least 660 planted acres of the
            insured crop in one section); or
          </P>
          <P>
            (F) Two or more units established by written agreement; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) At least two of the sections, section equivalents, FSA farm
            serial numbers, or units established by written agreement in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 34(a)(4)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (F)

            of 20 acres or 20 percent of the insured crop acreage in the
            enterprise unit. If there is planted acreage in more than two
            sections, section equivalents, FSA farm serial numbers or units
            established by written agreement in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 34(a)(4)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (F)
            </aref>
            , these can be aggregated to form at least two parcels to meet this
            requirement. For example, if sections are the basis for optional
            units where the insured acreage is located and you have 80 planted
            acres in section one, 10 planted acres in section two, and 10
            planted acres in section three, you may aggregate sections two and
            three to meet this requirement.

            to basic or optional units in any subsequent crop year, you must
            maintain separate records of acreage and production:

            will combine the optional units at any time we discover that you
            have failed to comply with these provisions. If failure to comply
            with these provisions is determined by us to be inadvertent, and the

            eligible to receive benefits for the same loss under any other USDA
            program, you may receive benefits under both programs, unless
            specifically limited by the crop insurance contract or by law.

            difference between the crop insurance payment and the actual amount
            of the loss, unless otherwise provided by law. The amount of the

            36. Substitution of Yields.
          </HD>
          <P>
            (a) When you have actual yields in your production history database
            that, due to an insurable cause of loss, are less than 60 percent of
            the applicable transitional yield you may elect, on an individual
            actual yield basis, to exclude and replace one or more of any such
            yields within each database.

            insured crop and each such election will remain in effect for
            succeeding years unless canceled by the production reporting date
            for the succeeding crop year. If you cancel an election, the actual
            yield will be used in the database. For example, if you elected to
            substitute yields in your database for the 1998 and 2000 crop year,
            for any subsequent crop year, you can elect to cancel the
            substitution for either or both years.
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) Each excluded actual yield will be replaced with a yield equal
            to 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield for the crop year
            in which the yield is being replaced (For example, if you elect to
            exclude a 2001 crop year actual yield, the transitional yield in
            effect for the 2001 crop year in the county will be used. If you
            also elect to exclude a 2002 crop year actual yield, the
            transitional yield in effect for the 2002 crop year in the county
            will be used). The replacement yields will be used in the same
            manner as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the approved
            yield.
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) Once you have elected to exclude an actual yield from the
            database, the replacement yield will remain in effect until such
            time as that crop year is no longer included in the database unless
            this election is canceled in accordance with

            (B) Any winter barley or winter wheat acreage that is replanted to a
            spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the
            winter type will be insured as the spring type and the production
            guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to
            the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be

            such final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area
            would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a
            spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is
            not practical.

            the spring sales closing date, and we determine, in writing, that
            the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield
            used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to
            inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance
            will attach as specified in

            (B) The fall planted barley or fall planted wheat will be insured as
            a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium,
            projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.
          </P>
          <P>
            (C) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine
            an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we
            do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting
            date.

            would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a
            spring type of the insured crop unless we agree it is not practical
            to replant.

          <P>
            (E) If fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded

          <P>
            (iii) Quality factors for Khorasan fall below the levels contained
            in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause durum
            wheat to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if durum wheat
            grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 54.0
            pounds per bushel, Khorasan would be eligible for quality adjustment
            if its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel. The same
            quality factors considered for quality adjustment of durum wheat
            will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in
            accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that
            establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of Khorasan seed.
            Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the
            Special Provisions will also apply to Khorasan at the same levels
            applicable to durum wheat;
          </P>
          <P>
            (iv) Quality factors for hull-less barley fall below the levels
            contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that
            cause barley to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if barley
            grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 40.0
            pounds per bushel, hull-less barley would be eligible for quality
            adjustment if its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel.
            The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of barley
            will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in
            accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that
            establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less
            barley. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades
            specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less
            barley at the same levels applicable to barley;
          </P>
          <P>
            (v) Quality factors for hull-less oats fall below the levels
            contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that
            cause oats to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if oats grade
            less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 27.0 pounds
            per bushel, hull-less oats would be eligible for quality adjustment
            if the test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel. The same
            quality factors considered for quality adjustment of oats will be
            applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in
            accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that
            establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less
            oats. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified
            in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less oats at the
            same levels applicable to oats; or

            (3) If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to count
            will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such
            production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation “A”
            by 85 percent of price quotation “B.”

            the per acre amount of insurance for each variety or population
            density for the crop must bear the same relationship to the maximum
            amount of insurance available for each variety and population
            density of the crop as specified in the Actuarial documents. For
            example, if you elect 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance
            for a variety within a population density for the crop, you must
            select 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for that
            variety for all population densities for the crop. The amount of
            insurance for each variety and population density must be multiplied
            by any applicable factor contained in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

          <P>
            (3) The amount of insurance per acre for each population density, or
            factor as appropriate, will be multiplied by the applicable number
            of insured acres. These results will then be added together to
            determine the amount of insurance for the unit.
          </P>
          <P>
            (4) The amount of insurance will be reduced proportionately for any
            unit on which the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the
            original planting pattern. For example, if the amount of insurance
            you selected is $2,000 and the remaining stand is 85 percent of the
            original stand, the amount of insurance on which the premium and any
            indemnity will be based is $1,700 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.85).

            occurred on the unit during the crop year and no fruit has been
            harvested. The producer elected the 75 percent coverage level and
            has a 100 percent share. The amount of insurance is $1,180 per acre,
            based on the 75 percent coverage level, for the citrus crop, fruit
            type, and age of trees. The amount of potential production is 24,530
            boxes and the amount of damaged production is 17,171 boxes. The loss

            marketable figs.
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade manufacturing grade

            delivered to the substandard pool will not be considered production
            to count, provided all the insured&apos;s substandard production is
            inspected by us and we give written consent to such delivery prior
            to delivery. If we do not give written consent prior to the delivery
            to the substandard pool, all production will be counted as undamaged
            marketable production. Substandard production for which we give
            written consent to you prior to delivery to the substandard pool,

          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Dividing the value per pound received for such substandard

          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of

          </P>
          <P>
            (3) Appraised production to be counted will include:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes and failure to
            follow recognized good fig farming practices;
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Not less than the production guarantee for the figs on any
            acreage:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) That is abandoned without our consent;
          </P>

          </P>
          <P>

            (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you want to
            abandon and no longer care for if you and we agree on the appraised
            amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for
            that acreage will end if you abandon the crop. If agreement on the
            appraised amount of production is not reached:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a
            subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine
            actual production. You must notify us within three days of the date
            harvest should have started if the crop is not harvested; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop. We will
            determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using
            the harvested production or our reappraisal if the crop is not
            harvested.

            whether such acreage is owned, rented for cash, or rented for a
            share of the crop. Your shares in the malting barley acreage insured
            under this endorsement must be designated separately on the acreage
            report. For example, if you have 100 percent share in 50 acres and
            75 percent share in 10 acres you must list the 50 acres separately
            from the 10 acres on

            even if more than one additional value price is applicable, and this
            percentage must be 100 percent or less). In the event you choose a
            percentage less than 100 percent of the additional value price, we
            will multiply that percentage by the additional value price
            specified in Option A or Option B, as applicable, to determine the
            additional value price applicable to this endorsement.
          </P>
          <P>
            8. The additional premium amount for this coverage will be
            determined by multiplying your malting barley production guarantee
            (per acre) by your additional value price, by the premium rate, by
            the acreage planted to approved malting barley varieties, by your
            share at the time coverage begins. The premium rate you pay will be
            adjusted by a malting barley factor contained in the actuarial
            documents, as applicable.

            (6) $152,500 total value guarantee—$122,000 total value of

          </P>

            (c) The total production to count (whole in-shell pounds) from all
            insurable acreage on the unit will include:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) All appraised production as follows:

          <P>
            (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
          </P>

            (iii) Unharvested production; and

            abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised
            amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for
            that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we
            may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the
            crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of
            further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you
            harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested
            production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our
            appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to
            determine the production to count; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) Mature walnut production damaged due to an insurable cause of
            loss which occurs within the insurance period may be adjusted for
            quality based on an inspection by the Dried Fruit Association or
            during our loss adjustment process. Walnut production that has mold
            damage greater than 8 percent, based on the net delivered weight,
            will be reduced by the quality adjustment factors contained in the
            Special Provisions. Walnut production that exceeds 30 percent mold
            damage and will not be sold, the production to count will be zero.

            production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our

            or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount
            of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that
            acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may
            defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop.
            We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further
            damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested
            the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you
            do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to
            deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to
            count; and

            one type of peanut is grown under a sheller contract and another is
            not, replanting payments will be valued using the price election
            elected by you for the planted acreage, as applicable (For an
            example, you have two sheller contracts and the base contract price
            is $0.23 per pound for Runner type peanuts, then $0.23 per pound
            will be used for the value of any replanted Runner type peanut
            acreage. If the base contract price is $0.21 per pound for Spanish
            type peanuts, then $0.21 per pound will be used for the value of any
            replanted Spanish type peanut acreage.

            (2) If the sheller contracts are for the same type of peanuts but
            they have different base contract prices:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) If the peanuts under each sheller contract are insured in
            separate optional units, each respective price election from each
            sheller contract will apply to each respective unit; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) If all or some of peanuts under both sheller contracts are
            insured in the same unit, then the replanted acreage will be
            prorated to each contract based on the number of acres needed to
            fulfill each contract (For example, if there are 20 acres in the
            unit and 10 were replanted, the production guarantee per acre for
            the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, and the contract for $0.23 was
            for 25,000 pounds and the contract for $0.21 was for 15,000 pounds,
            then the acreage under the $0.23 contract constitutes 62.5 percent
            of the acreage in the unit (25,000/40,000) and the other sheller
            contract 37.5 percent of the acreage (15,000/40,000). Of the 10
            acres replanted, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid at the $0.23
            price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would be paid at the $0.21
            price election).
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) If the peanuts are not grown under a contract, the replanting
            payments will be valued using the price election as specified in the
            Special Provisions. If the unit has peanuts grown under a sheller
            contract and peanuts not grown under a sheller contract, the
            replanted acreage must be prorated between the contract and
            non-contract acreage by determining the acreage grown under a
            contract and the remaining acreage in the unit (For example, if
            there are 20 acres in the unit and 10 were replanted, the production
            guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, there is a
            sheller contract for $0.23 for 25,000 pounds, the remaining peanuts
            are not grown under a sheller contract, and the price 
            <PRTPAGE P='254' />
            election in the Special Provisions is for $0.20. The peanuts under
            the sheller contract constitute 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the
            acreage in the unit and remaining peanuts constitute 37.5 percent
            (40,000−25,000/40,000) of the acreage. Of the 10 acres replanted,
            6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the liability based on the
            $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would be paid with
            the liability based on the $0.20 price election).
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable
            for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced
            by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not
            be reduced.
          </P>
          <P>
            (e) Replanting payments will be calculated using your price election
            and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and
            insured. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the
            replanted type, if applicable.

          <P>
            (1) If the sheller contracts are for different types of peanuts or
            one type of peanut is grown under a sheller contract and another is
            not, the liability will be determined using the price election
            elected by you for planted acreage, as applicable (For an example,
            you have two sheller contracts and the base contract price is $0.23
            per pound for Runner type peanuts, then $0.23 per pound will be used
            for the value of any prevented planting Runner type peanut acreage.
            If the base contract price is $0.21 per pound for Spanish type
            peanuts, then $0.21 per pound will be used for the value of any
            prevented planting Spanish type peanut acreage.
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) If the sheller contracts are for the same type of peanuts but
            they have different base contract prices:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) If the peanuts grown under each sheller contract are insured in
            separate optional units, the liability will be determined using each
            respective price election for the prevented planting acreage in each
            respective unit; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) If all or some of the peanuts grown under the sheller contracts
            are insured in the same unit, then the liability for each contract
            must be determined separately using the respective price election
            and the number of eligible prevented planting acres to which the
            liability applies and will be determined by prorating prevented
            planting acreage to each contract based on the number of acres
            needed to fulfill each contract (For example, if there are 20 acres
            in the unit and 10 were prevented from planting, the production
            guarantee per acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, and the
            contract for $0.23 was for 25,000 pounds and the contract for $0.21
            was for 15,000 pounds, then the acreage under the $0.23 contract
            constitutes 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the acreage in the unit
            and the other contract 37.5 percent 
            <PRTPAGE P='256' />
            (15,000/40,000) of the acreage. Of the 10 acres prevented from
            planting, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the liability
            based on the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 × .375) would
            be paid with the liability based on the $0.21 price election).
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) If the peanuts are not grown under a contract, the liability for
            such peanuts will be based on the price election as specified in the
            Special Provisions. If the unit has peanuts grown under a sheller
            contract and peanuts not grown under a sheller contract, the
            eligible prevented planting acreage must be determined by
            determining the acreage grown under a contract and the remaining
            acreage in the unit (For example, if there are 20 acres in the unit
            and 10 were prevented from planting, the production guarantee per
            acre for the unit is 2,000 pounds per acre, there is a sheller
            contract for $0.23 for 25,000 pounds, the remaining peanuts are not
            grown under a sheller contract, and the price election in the
            Special Provisions is for $0.20. The peanuts under the sheller
            contract constitute 62.5 percent (25,000/40,000) of the acreage in
            the unit and remaining peanuts constitute 37.5 percent
            (40,000−25,000/40,000) of the acreage. Of the 10 acres prevented
            from planting, 6.25 acres (10 × .625) would be paid with the
            liability based on the $0.23 price election and 3.75 acres (10 ×
            .375) would be paid with the liability based on the $0.20 price

            You have 100 percent share in a unit to produce 3,000 pounds of

            In lieu of late planting provisions in the Basic Provisions
            regarding acreage initially planted after the final planting date,
            insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop

            length of each field in each unit. The samples must not be destroyed

            may inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and

            the peas delivered to the processor by the base contract price per

            </aref>
             for any acreage you intended to harvest as dry peas. The harvested
            or appraised dry pea production will be multiplied by 1.667 for
            shell types and 3.000 for pod types to determine the green pea
            production equivalent. No adjustment for quality deficiencies will
            be allowed for dry pea production.

            the earlier of the date the damaged production is sold or the date
            of final inspection for the unit. The average market price of

            being paid by usual marketing outlets for the area during the week
            in which the damaged grapes were valued.

                   You have a 100 percent share in 10.0 acres of fresh market
                  tomatoes. You select a 70% coverage level of the reference
                  maximum dollar amount of $7,500 per acre. The average price
                  received is $6.00 per carton of tomatoes. Allowable costs are
                  $4.25 per carton. Minimum value is $5.00 per carton. The
                  Minimum Value Option price is $2.00 per carton. Your total
                  sold production is 5,000 cartons (5,000 ÷ 10.0 = 500 cartons
                  per acre) and you have an additional 1,000 cartons of unsold
                  harvested production (1,000 ÷ 10.0 = 100 cartons per acre).
                  Your loss occurred in the final stage of production. Your
                  total indemnity is calculated as follows:

          </P>
          <P>
            (4) The acreage must have been initially planted to a spring type of
            the insured crop in those counties with only a spring final planting
            date;
          </P>
          <P>
            (5) When the Winter Coverage Option is in effect for the acreage,
            damage must occur after the fall final planting date in those
            counties where both a fall and spring final planting date are
            designated;

          <P>
            (6) Replanting payments are not available for damaged fall planted
            dry pea acreage if you have not elected to cover such acreage under
            the Winter Coverage Option; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (7) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to
            achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that
            will produce at least the yield used to determine your production
            guarantee.
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be
            the lesser of 20.0 percent of the production guarantee or 200
            pounds, multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your share,
            unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions.
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable
            for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced
            by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not
            be reduced.
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) Replanting payments will be calculated using the price election
            and production guarantee for the dry pea type that is replanted and
            insured. For example, if damaged smooth green and yellow pea acreage
            is replanted to lentils, the price election and production guarantee
            applicable to lentils will be used to calculate any replanting
            payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required
            to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two
            sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on the
            guarantee and price election for the crop type initially planted:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) Any damaged fall-planted type of dry peas replanted to a
            spring-planted type that retains insurance based on the production
            guarantee and price election for the fall-planted type; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially
            damaged stand of the insured crop.

          <P>
            (i) The highest local market price for the qualifying damaged
            production will be determined on the earlier of the date such
            damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the
            unit. The highest local market price for the qualifying damaged
            production will be determined in the local area to the extent
            feasible. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we
            obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local
            market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs
            required to deliver the dry peas to those buyers. Discounts used to
            establish the net value of the damaged production will be limited to
            those that are usual, customary, and reasonable.

            (C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with
            normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the dry peas; except,
            if the value of the damaged production can be increased by
            conditioning, we may reduce the value of the production after it has
            been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the
            value of the production before conditioning;
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) The value per pound of the damaged or conditioned production
            will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality
            adjustment factor;
          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) The number of pounds of the damaged or conditioned production
            will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to
            determine the production count to be included in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight
            basis.

            remain in effect; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage:
          </P>
          <P>

            guarantee. This amount will be considered production to count in
            determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to
            settle your claim as described in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 13

          <P>
            (ii) You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting
            and separately insuring any other crop if such insurance is
            available.
          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) If you elect to plant and elect to insure spring-planted dry
            pea acreage of the same dry pea type (you must elect whether or not
            you want insurance on the spring-planted acreage of the same dry pea
            type at the time we release the fall-planted acreage), you must pay
            additional premium for insurance. Such acreage will be insured in
            accordance with the policy provisions that are applicable to acreage
            that is initially planted in the spring to the same dry pea type,
            and you must:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) Plant the spring-planted acreage in a manner which results in a
            clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary
            between it and any remaining acreage of the fall-planted dry pea
            acreage; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) Store or market the production in a manner which permits us to
            verify the amount of spring-planted production separately from any
            fall-planted production. In the event you are unable to provide
            records of production that are acceptable to us, the spring-planted
            acreage will be considered to be a part of the original fall-planted
            unit.

            must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price
            election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100
            percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also
            choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other

          <P>
            (1) All appraised production as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) That is abandoned;
          </P>
          <P>

          <P>
            (D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade
            inspection; or

          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity.
            Production to count from such acreage will be determined by
            increasing the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day
            for each day the potatoes were harvested prior to the date the
            potatoes would have reached full maturity. The date the potatoes
            would have reached full maturity will be considered to be 45 days
            prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period,
            unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. This
            adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are damaged by an
            insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field would
            either reduce production or decrease quality;

          <P>
            (iv) Unharvested production, including unharvested production on
            insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, or
            acreage damaged by insurable causes and for which you cease to
            provide further care, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of
            production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that
            acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or cease
            providing care for the crop. This unharvested production may be
            adjusted in accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              sections 11(e), (f), and (g)
            </aref>
            ; and the value of all unharvested production will be calculated
            using the reduced price election determined in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 2(b)

          <P>
            (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may
            give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to
            leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative
            samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to
            determine the amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified

            production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested
            production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should
            have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or
            fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made
            prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will
            be used to determine the amount of production to count); or

            production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the
            crop is not harvested; and

          <P>
            (2) A grade inspection is completed no later than 21 days after the
            end of the insurance period (if the Northern Potato Storage Coverage
            Endorsement is applicable, samples must be obtained within 60 days
            after the end of the insurance period and quality (grade)
            determinations must be completed with 21 days of sampling); and

          <P>
            (3) Prior to any grade inspection, you must notify us of the
            intended use of the potatoes so the appropriate United States
            standards will be applied (We may request previous sales records to
            verify your claimed intended use or base the intended use on the
            type of potato grown if such potatoes are not usually grown for the
            intended use you reported).

            1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the
            actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part
            of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and
            conditions described herein. In accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 8
            </aref>
            , since your insurance period is not extended in this endorsement,
            any additional premium paid for coverage under the Northern Potato
            Storage Coverage Endorsement will not apply to the additional
            coverage provided under the terms of this endorsement. In the event
            of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this

          <P>
            2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing
            date for the initial crop year you wish to insure your potatoes
            under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect
            until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any

            3. All potatoes grown on insurable acreage and that are entered into
            the potato seed certification program administered by the state in
            which the seed is grown must be insured unless limited by 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

          <P>
            4. Your certified seed production guarantee per-acre will be the
            per-acre production guarantee used to cover the same acreage under
            the terms of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. However, unless a
            written agreement provides otherwise, if the total amount of
            insurable certified seed acreage you have for the current crop year
            is greater than 125 percent of your average number of acres entered
            into and passing certification in the potato certified seed program
            in the three previous calendar years, your certified seed production
            guarantee for each unit will be reduced as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Multiply the average number of your acres entered into and
            passing certification in the potato certified seed program the 3
            previous calendar years by 1.25 and divide this result by the number
            of acres grown by you for certified seed in the current crop year;
            and
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) Multiply the result of

              section 4(a)

            for the current crop year.
          </P>
          <P>
            5. You must provide acceptable records of your certified seed potato
            acreage and production for the previous three years. These records
            must clearly indicate the number of your acres entered into the
            potato seed certification program administered by the state in which
            the seed is grown.
          </P>
          <P>
            6. All potatoes insured for certified seed production must be
            produced and managed in accordance with the regulations, standards,
            practices, and procedures required for certification under the
            potato certified seed program. Any production that does not qualify
            as certified seed because of varietal mixing or your failure to meet
            any requirements under the potato certified seed program will be
            considered as lost due to uninsured causes.
          </P>
          <P>
            7. If, due to insurable causes occurring within the insurance
            period, the amount of certified seed you produce is less than your
            certified seed production guarantee, we will settle your claim by:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective certified seed
            production guarantee;

            qualify as certified seed and any amount of production lost due to
            uninsured causes, or that does not qualify as certified seed due to

            in the Special Provisions for production covered under this

            8. You must notify us of any loss under this endorsement not later
            than 14 days after you receive notice from the state certification
            agency that any acreage or production has failed certification.
            Nothing herein extends the insurance period beyond the time period
            specified in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 8 of
            </aref>
             the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 11 of
            </aref>
             the Basic Provisions. In lieu of the provisions in 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 14(c) of
            </aref>
             the Basic Provisions specifying that any claim for indemnity must
            be filed not later than 60 days after the end of the insurance
            period, your claim for indemnity must be filed by the later of:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Sixty (60) days after the end of the insurance period; or
          </P>

          </P>
          <P>
            9. Acreage covered under the terms of this endorsement will have the
            same unit structure as provided under the Basic Provisions and the
            Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if you have two
            optional units (00101 and 00102) under your Northern Potato Crop
            Insurance Policy and you elect this endorsement, you will also have
            two optional units (00201 and 00202) for certified seed coverage,
            provided that certified seed is grown in both units 00101 and 00102.
            Or, if you have two basic units (00100 and 00200) under your
            Northern Potato Crop Insurance Policy and you elect this
            endorsement, you will also have two basic units (00300 and 00400)
            for certified seed coverage, provided that certified seed is grown
            in both units 00100 and 00200. In the event certified seed acreage
            is not grown in the same optional or basic units as acreage covered
            under the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions,
            certified seed units will be established in accordance with the unit
            division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions and the
            Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if a basic unit is
            divided into two optional units for potato acreage covered under the
            Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, but
            certified seed is grown in only one of those optional units, the
            certified seed acreage will be insured as one basic unit.
          </P>
          <P>
            10. Failure to meet any requirements for seed to be used to produce
            a subsequent seed crop will not be covered. All the production that
            meets requirements for certified seed used to produce a commercial
            crop will be included in production to count.

            1. In return for payment of the required additional premium as
            contained in the actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached
            to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to
            the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a
            conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this
            endorsement, this endorsement will control.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing
            date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your
            potatoes under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in
            effect until canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for
            any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party
            on or before the cancellation date.
          </P>
          <P>
            3. Potato production grown under a contract that requires the
            production to be delivered to a buyer within three days of harvest
            will not be insured under this endorsement. When such contract
            requires delivery of a stated amount of production, rather than all
            of the production from a stated amount of acres, the number of acres
            not insured under this endorsement will be determined by dividing
            the stated amount of production by the approved yield for the
            acreage. All other potato production insured under the Northern
            Potato Crop Provisions must be insured under this endorsement unless
            the Special Provisions allow you to exclude certain potato
            varieties, types, or groups from this endorsement, and you elect to
            exercise this option. If you elect this endorsement, such exclusions
            must be shown annually on your acreage report and will be applicable
            to all acreage of the excluded varieties, types, or groups for the
            crop year.
          </P>
          <P>
            4. When production from separate insurance units, basic or optional,
            is commingled in storage, the production to count for each unit will
            be allocated pro rata based on the production placed in storage from
            each unit. 
            <PRTPAGE P='297' />
            Such allocation will be allowed only if verifiable records of
            production placed in storage are available by unit. If you do not
            have verifiable records, all units without verifiable records will
            be combined in accordance with 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 11 of
            </aref>
             the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if 500
            hundredweight from one unit are commingled with 1,500 hundredweight
            from another unit and the production to count from the stored
            production is 1,000 hundredweight, 250 hundredweight of production
            to count will be allocated to the unit contributing 500
            hundredweight and 750 hundredweight to the unit contributing 1500
            hundredweight to the stored production. This provision does not
            eliminate or change any other requirement contained in this policy
            to provide or maintain separate records of acreage or production by
            unit.

          <P>
            5. In lieu of 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 9(b)(1) of
            </aref>
             the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, the extended coverage provided
            by this endorsement will be applicable but only if:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Insured potatoes are damaged within the insurance period by an
            insured cause other than freeze that later results in:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) Tuber rot as defined in the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, to
            the extent that 5.1 percent (by weight) or more of the insured
            production is affected;
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) Internal defects to the extent that such defects are in excess
            of the amount allowed for the U.S. grade standard you elected for
            purposes of coverage under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance
            Quality Endorsement. Such defects must not be separable from
            undamaged production using methods used by the packers or processors
            to which you normally deliver your potato production. This coverage
            is applicable only to production covered under the Northern Potato
            Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) The potatoes damaged by an insurance cause of loss fail to meet
            any of the following standards or a less stringent standard for the
            same quality factors specified below, contained in the processor
            contract, if applicable, (this coverage is applicable only to
            production covered under the Northern Potato Processing Quality
            Endorsement):
          </P>
          <P>

          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) A fry color of No. 3 or darker due to either sugar exceeding 10
            percent or sugar ends exceeding 19 percent; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) An Agtron rating lower than 58.
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) You notify us within 72 hours of your initial discovery of any
            damage that has or that may later result in the quality deficiencies
            specified in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

             is determined based on samples obtained no later than 60 days after
            the end of the insurance period and the potatoes are evaluated and
            quality (grade) determinations are made by us, a laboratory approved
            by us, a potato grader licensed or certified by the applicable State
            or the United States Department of Agriculture, or us, in accordance
            with the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) Samples of damaged production must be obtained by us or a party
            approved by us prior to the sale or disposal of any lot of potatoes;
            and
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) If production is not sold or disposed of within 60 days after
            the end of the insurance period, samples must be obtained within 60
            days after the end of the insurance period and a quality (grade)
            determination must be completed within 21 days of sampling.

             In lieu of the definition of “Practical to replant” contained in
            section one of the Basic Provisions, practical to replant is defined
            as our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop,
            based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture
            availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and time to
            crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow the
            crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of

            after the end of the late planting period, or the end of the

            which the Special Provisions designates separate planting periods,

            Special Provisions provide for different price elections by type,

            the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type
            must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price
            election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100

          <P>
            For example: You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of
            potatoes in the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre
            and a price election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able
            to harvest 10,000 hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated
            as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;

            (4) 10,000 hundredweight × $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value

          </P>
          <P>
            (5) $60,000.00 − $40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and

          <P>
            (6) $20,000.00 × 100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.

            You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of
            potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per
            acre and a price election of $3.60 per hundredweight. (The price
            election for unharvested acreage is 90.0 percent of your elected
            price election ($4.00 × 0.90 = $3.60.)) This unharvested acreage was
            appraised at 35 hundredweight per acre for a total of 3500
            hundredweight as production to count. Your total indemnity for the
            harvested and unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:

            (1) 100 acres × 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee

          <P>
            (2) 15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $4.00 price election =

          <P>
            15,000 hundredweight guarantee × $3.60 price election = $54,000.00

          </P>
          <P>
            (3) $60,000.00 + $54,000.00 = $114,000.00 total value of guarantee;

          <P>
            (6) $114,000.00 − $52,600.00 = $61,400.00 loss; and

          <P>
            (7) $61,400.00 loss × 100 percent = $61,400.00 indemnity payment.

          <P>
            (c) The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on
            samples obtained no later than the time potatoes are placed in
            storage, if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they
            are delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other
            handler if production is not stored.

            (d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all
            insurable acreage on the unit will include:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) All appraised production as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) That is abandoned;
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
          </P>
          <P>
            (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;
          </P>
          <P>
            (D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade
            inspection; or
          </P>
          <P>
            (E) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
          </P>
          <P>
            (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
          </P>
          <P>
            (iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity.
            Production to count from such acreage will be determined by
            increasing the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day
            for each day the potatoes were harvested prior to the date the
            potatoes would have reached full maturity. The date the potatoes
            would have reached full maturity will be considered to be 45 days
            prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period,
            unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. This
            adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are damaged by an
            insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field would
            either reduce production or decrease quality.
          </P>
          <P>
            (iv) Unharvested production, including unharvested production on
            insured acreage you intend to put to another use or abandon, or
            acreage damaged by insurable causes and for which you cease to
            provide further care, 
            <PRTPAGE P='301' />
            if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such
            agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you
            put the acreage to another use or cease providing care for the crop.
            This unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              sections 12(e)
            </aref>
            , and the value of all unharvested production will be calculated

          </P>
          <P>
            (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may
            give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to
            leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative
            samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to
            determine the amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified

            </aref>
             even if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of
            production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested
            production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should
            have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or
            fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made
            prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will
            be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of
            production to count for the acreage will be the harvested
            production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the
            crop is not harvested; and

          <P>
            (e) Only marketable lots of mature potatoes will be production to
            count for loss adjustment purposes, except for production specified
            in 12(e)(1):
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) Production not meeting the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 due

            Standard will be applied (We may request previous sales records to
            verify your claimed intended use or base the intended use on the
            type of potato grown if such potatoes are not usually grown for the
            intended use you reported).

            the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 grade or better on a sample
            basis.
          </P>
          <P>
            (5) Marketable lots will also include any potatoes that we
            determine:

            subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine
            actual production (If we require you to continue to care for the

            harvested.

            (3) The total value of all harvested production from the insurable
            acreage will be the dollar amount obtained by subtracting the
            allowable cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price
            received for each box of peppers (this result may not be less than
            the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for any box of
            peppers), and multiplying this result by the number of boxes of
            peppers harvested. Harvested production that is damaged or defective
            due to insurable causes and is not marketable, will not be counted
            as production to count.

            (2) All harvested production from insurable acreage regardless of
            condition or disposition. The quantity of production to count for
            table grape production damaged by insurable causes within the
            insurance period that is marketed for any use other than table
            grapes will be determined by multiplying the greater of (1) the
            value of the table grapes per ton or (2) $50, by the number of tons
            and dividing that result by the highest price election available for
            the insured unit. This result will be the number of lugs to count.

            (3) If you only have processing peach acreage designated on your

            closing date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage

            provide different price elections by type, in which case you may
            select one price election for each apple type designated in the

            must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price
            offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent
            of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100
            percent of the maximum price election for all other types.

            tomatoes in the county insured under this policy unless the Special
            Provisions provide different price elections by type. The percentage
            of the maximum price election you choose for one type will be

            (c) The price election used to determine the amount of an indemnity

            the price used for final stage losses. Stages will be determined on
            an acre basis. The stages and applicable price elections are:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) First stage is from planting until first fruit set. If any
            acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price
            used to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage
            will be 50 percent of your price election;
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) Second stage is from the first fruit set until harvest. If any
            acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price
            used to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage
            will be 80 percent of your price election; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (3) Third stage (final stage) is harvested acreage. The price
            election used in this stage to establish the amount of any indemnity
            owed will be 100 percent of your price election.
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) Any acreage of tomatoes damaged to the extent, that the majority
            of producers in the area would not normally further care for the
            tomatoes, will be deemed to have been destroyed even though you may
            continue to care for it. The price election used to determine the
            amount of an indemnity will be that applicable to the stage in which
            the tomatoes were destroyed.

            (expressed as usable or payable weight).
          </P>

            (3) All harvested tomato production delivered to processor which
            does not meet the quality requirements of the processor contract due
            to not being timely delivered.

          <P>
            (d) Once harvest has begun on any acreage covered by a processor
            contract that specifies the number of tons to be delivered, the
            total indemnity payable will be limited to an amount based on the
            lesser of the guaranteed tons, or the tons remaining unfulfilled
            under the processor contract.

            final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would
            normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a fall

            $80,000. The under-report factor is .80 ($100,000 divided by

            Assume you have a second loss on the same basic unit. Your amount of
            insurance has been reduced by subtracting your previous indemnity
            payment of $11,000 from your amount of insurance ($75,000 − $11,000
            = $64,000). Your crop year deductible has been reduced to zero by
            the previous loss ($25,000 − $36,000, but not less than zero). You
            purchase a Peak Inventory Endorsement and report $60,000 in
            inventory. Your peak amount of insurance is your reported inventory
            times your coverage level ($60,000 × .75 = $45,000). The combined
            amount of insurance for the coverage term of the peak endorsement is
            $64,000 + $45,000 = $109,000. Your crop year deductible is increased
            by $15,000 ($60,000 × .25). At the time of loss, field market value
            A is $124,000, and field market value B is $58,000. The under-report
            factor is 1.00 [($160,000 − $36,000)/$124,000]. The crop year
            deductible is $15,000 (.25 × $60,000) and the occurrence deductible
            is $15,000 (the lesser of field market value A × .25 or the crop

          <P>
            Your peak amount of insurance is reduced to zero. Your amount of

            and 0.52 for the month following the month containing the coverage
            termination date, as stated in the actuarial documents. The peak

          <P>
            (a) You may select only one coverage level for both years of the
            two-year coverage module for all pecans in the county. By giving us
            written notice, you may change the coverage level for the succeeding

            (c) For coverage under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement,

            revenue per acre multiplied by the percentage listed in the Special
            Provisions and multiplied by the net acres.

          <P>
            (2) You increase the previous year&apos;s insured acreage by more

            by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used
            to determine your production to count for production that is sold by
            direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will
            conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any
            acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine the
            dollar value of your production to count. Failure to give timely
            notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result
            in an appraised dollar value of production to count that is not less
            than the amount of insurance per acre for the direct-marketed
            acreage if such failure results in our inability to make the
            required appraisal.
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity, you must notify us at least
            15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if a loss
            occurs during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged
            production.
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) You must not sell, destroy or dispose of the damaged crop until
            after we have given you written consent to do so.
          </P>
          <P>
            (e) If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such
            failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production,
            all such production will be considered undamaged and included as
            production to count.
          </P>
          <P>
            (f) You may be required to harvest a sample, selected by us, to be

            Example # 2 (with two base contract prices for the same unit):

            (7) $1,625 total value guarantee—$1,175 total value of production to

            2. CEO is only available for insured crops where the actuarial
            documents contain a CEO coverage level. If there is a conflict
            between the terms of CEO and any other provision of your policy, the
            terms of the CEO will control.
          </P>
          <P>
            3. To be eligible for CEO coverage on the insured crop, you must:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Have an MPCI policy in force for the insured crop (or for citrus
            fruit, citrus trees, and stone fruit or other crops, as applicable,
            the insured type) and comply with all terms and conditions of such
            policy.
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) Elect CEO in writing and choose a CEO coverage level (at least 5
            percent higher than the MPCI coverage level), by the sales closing
            date for the insured crop.
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) Elect a level of coverage greater than the Catastrophic Risk
            Protection (CAT) coverage level and a 100 percent price election.
            CEO is not available for the CAT level of coverage.
          </P>
          <P>
            4. CEO is continuous and will remain in effect for as long as you
            continue to have a MPCI policy in effect for the insured crop, the
            actuarial documents contain a CEO coverage level, or until it is
            canceled by you or terminated by us on or before the cancellation or
            termination date, as applicable.
          </P>
          <P>
            5. The premium for your policy will be determined by:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Totaling the MPCI dollar amount of insurance and the CEO dollar
            amount of insurance; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) Multiplying the result of 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 5(a)
            </aref>
             by the premium rate for the insured crop applicable to your MPCI
            coverage level
          </P>
          <P>
            6. With respect to the coverage provided under CEO:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) All acreage of the insured crop insured under your MPCI policy
            will be covered under the CEO;
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) The amount of any replant or prevented planting payment that is
            payable under the MPCI policy will not be affected by the CEO;
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) An indemnity will be payable under the CEO only after the
            underlying MPCI deductible is met and an MPCI indemnity is paid; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) The total indemnity for each unit (MPCI coverage plus CEO)
            cannot exceed the combination of both the MPCI and CEO dollar
            amounts of insurance.
          </P>
          <P>
            7. If you elect CEO and a MPCI indemnity is paid on any unit, CEO
            will pay a portion of the loss not paid under the deductible of the
            MPCI policy depending on the CEO coverage level you select (For
            example, if you selected a 50 percent MPCI coverage level, selected
            an 85 percent CEO coverage level, and had 60 percent loss of the
            insured crop, the total amount of indemnity paid under both the MPCI
            policy and the CEO would be equal to approximately 51 percent of the
            total value of the insured crop by unit). See the example in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              section 8
            </aref>
            .
          </P>
          <P>
            8. In addition to the settlement of claim section for the applicable
            Crop Provisions, your indemnity will be computed for each unit as
            follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) Determine the MPCI indemnity factor;
          </P>
          <P>
            (b) Determine the total value of the insured crop by unit;
          </P>
          <P>
            (c) Determine the CEO dollar amount of insurance; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (d) Multiply the MPCI indemnity factor times the CEO dollar amount
            of insurance to determine the indemnity under the CEO.
          </P>
          <P>
            <E T='03'>
              Example:
            </E>
             Assume a policy with one unit; an MPCI coverage level of 50 percent
            and a CEO coverage level of 85 percent; 100% share; a $120,000 MPCI
            dollar amount of insurance; and a $72,000 payable indemnity under
            the MPCI portion of the policy.
          </P>
          <P>
            Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (a) $72,000 MPCI loss ÷ by $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance

          </P>
          <P>
            (b) $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance, divided by the MPCI

            (c) $240,000 total value of the insured crop by unit multiplied by
            the CEO coverage level .85, equals $204,000, and subtracting
            $120,000 MPCI dollar amount of insurance equals $84,000 CEO dollar
            amount of insurance;

          <P>
            (d) .60 MPCI indemnity factor × $84,000 CEO dollar amount of

            provide that you may select a different coverage level for each
            avocado type designated in the Special Provisions. However, if you
            elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of coverage, the
            CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all types of avocados
            you produce in the county.

            must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price
            offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent
            of the maximum price election for one type, you must choose 100
            percent of the maximum price election for the other type. However,
            if you elect the CAT level of coverage, the price election
            percentage will be equal to 55 percent of the applicable price

            You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of early variety A in the
            unit, with a guarantee of 140 bushels per acre and a price election
            of $16.00 per bushel. You are only able to harvest 6,000 bushels due
            to an insured cause of loss. Your indemnity would be calculated as
            follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            (1) 50 acres × 140 bushels = 7,000 bushel guarantee;

          <P>
            (2) 7,000 bushels × $16.00 price election = $112,000.00 value of
            guarantee;
          </P>
          <P>
            (4) 6,000 bushels × $16.00 price election = $96,000.00 value of
            production to count;
          </P>
          <P>
            (6) $112,000.00 − $96,000.00 = $16,000 loss; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (7) $16,000 × 100 percent = $16,000 indemnity.

            acceptable to us;

          <P>
            (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to
            abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised
            amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for
            that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we
            may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the
            crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of
            further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you
            harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested
            production. If you do not continue to adequately care for the crop,
            our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to
            determine the production to count; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
