             is a dealer primarily engaged in the full-line wholesale
            distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood items (such
            as perishable agricultural commodities, dry groceries, general
            merchandise, meat, poultry, and seafood, and health and beauty care
            items) to retailers. This term does not include persons primarily
            engaged in the wholesale distribution and resale of perishable
            agricultural commodities rather than other grocery and related
            nonfood items. Specifically, for an entity to be considered a
            grocery wholesaler, 50 percent or more of its annual gross sales
            must be from the full-line distribution and resale of grocery and
            related nonfood items, and it cannot have 
            <PRTPAGE P='257' />
            more than 50 percent of its sales in perishable agricultural
            commodities. “Full line” means that an entity must be supplying the
            retailer with a wide range of products such as the grocery and
            related nonfood items specified.

          its liability, if such violation is found by the Director not to have

          application and paying the amount of fees that it would have paid had
          it obtained and maintained a license during the period that it engaged
          in business subject to the Act, plus an additional sum not in excess
          of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) as may be determined by the
          Director.

             When the licensee, or if the licensee is a partnership, any partner
            is subject to proceedings under the bankruptcy laws. A new license
            is required in case of a change in the ownership of a firm, the
            addition or withdrawal of partners in a partnership, or in case
            business is conducted under a different corporate charter, or in
            case a limited liability company conducts business under different
            articles or organization from those under which the license was

          An identifying lot number shall be assigned to each shipment of
          produce to be sold on consignment or joint account or for the account
          of another person or firm. A lot number should be assigned to any
          purchased shipment in dispute between the parties to assist in proving
          damages. A lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment of
          similar produce on hand at that time or received later while the
          consigned or joint account or disputed lot is being sold. A lot number
          shall be assigned to each purchased shipment which is reconditioned if
          the seller is to be charged with the shrinkage or loss. The lot number
          shall be entered on the receiving record in connection with each
          shipment and entered on all sales tickets identifying and segregating
          the sales from the various shipments on hand. The lot number shall be
          entered on the sales tickets by the salesmen at the time of sale or by
          the produce dispatcher, and not by bookkeepers or others after the
          sales have been made. No lot number shall be repeated within a period
          of 30 days after the last sale from the preceding lot to which such
          number was assigned.

        <P>
          Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the commodity
          has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a local
          health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper has
          specifically consented to such disposition. The term “commercial
          value” means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that
          can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without
          unreasonable expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled
          for or on behalf of another person, proof as to the quantities of
          produce destroyed or dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment
          shall be provided by procuring an official certificate showing that
          the produce has no commercial value from any person authorized by the
          Department to inspect fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection
          service is not available certification may be obtained from (a) any
          health officer or food inspector of any State, county, parish, city or
          municipality or of the District of Columbia; (b) any established
          commercial agency or service making inspections for the fruit and
          vegetable industry; or (c) when no inspector or health officer
          designated above is available consideration will be given to other
          evidence such as inspection and certification made by any two persons
          having no financial interest in the produce involved or in the
          business of any person financially interested therein, and who are
          unrelated by blood or marriage to any such financially interested
          person, and who, at the time of the inspection and certification, and
          for a period of at least one year immediately prior thereto, have been
          engaged in the handling of the same general kind or class of produce
          with respect to which the inspections and certification are to be
          made. Any certificate issued by any persons designated in paragraph
          (c) of this section shall include a statement that each of them
          possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such certificate shall
          properly identify the produce by showing the commodity, lot number,
          brand or principal identifying marks on the containers, quantity
          dumped, name and address of shipper, name and address of applicant,
          condition of the produce, time, place, and date of inspection and a
          statement that the produce possesses no commercial value.

          Commission merchants, dealers and brokers who offer produce for sale
          through auction companies which publish catalogs of offerings will be
          responsible for furnishing the auction company for publication true
          and correct information concerning the ownership of the produce. When
          the produce is offered for sale by an owner, his name shall be shown
          in the catalog listing as owner. When a joint account partner makes an
          offering, his name as well as that of his joint partner, or partners,
          shall be shown. When any person offers produce for sale at auction for
          the account of another, the 
          <PRTPAGE P='265' />
          name, or names of the owner, if known, and of his principal shall be
          shown. In addition to listing such name or names he may show that he
          is acting in the capacity of agent. If a person instructs an auction
          company to catalog a shipment without disclosing true ownership, if
          known, or the name of an agent&apos;s principal, he shall be deemed to
          have made a false or misleading statement within the meaning of the
          Act. Since sales at auctions normally involve additional expenses, a
          broker, grower&apos;s agent or commission merchant shall have prior
          consent from his principal before such disposition is accomplished.
          Where a dispute exists regarding the ownership of produce, it may be
          listed in the auction catalog as being offered for sale “for the
          account of whom concerned” with the name of the party making the
          offering shown as agent.

             Brokers carry on their business operations in several different
            ways and are generally classified by their method of operation. The
            following are some of the broad groupings by method of operation.
            The usual operation of brokers consists of the negotiation of the
            purchase and sale of produce either of one commodity or of several
            commodities. A broker is usually engaged by only one of the parties,
            but in negotiating a contract the broker acts as a special agent of
            first one and then the other party in conveying offers, counter
            offers, and acceptances between the parties. Once the contract is
            formed, and the confirmation issued, the broker&apos;s duties are
            usually ended, and the broker is not the proper party to whom notice
            of breach or of rejection should be directed. However, a broker
            receiving notice has a duty to promptly convey the notice to the
            proper party. Frequently, brokers never see the produce they are
            quoting for sale or negotiating for purchase by the buyer, and they
            carry out their duties by conveying information received from the
            parties between the buyer and seller until a contract is effected.
            Generally, the seller of the produce invoices the buyer, however,
            when there is a specific agreement between the broker and its
            principal, the seller invoices the broker who, in turn, invoices the
            buyer, collects, and remits to the seller. Under other types of
            agreements, the seller ships the produce to pool buyers, and the
            broker as an accommodation to the seller invoices the buyers,
            collects, and remits to the seller. Also, there are times when the
            broker is authorized by the seller to act much like a commission
            merchant, being given blanket authority to dispose of the produce
            for the seller&apos;s account either by negotiation of sales to
            buyers not known to the seller or by placing the produce for sale on
            consignment with receivers in the terminal markets.

          <text>
             There is a second general grouping of brokers which are commonly
            referred to as buying brokers. Their operations are typified by the
            fact that they act as the buyer&apos;s representative in negotiating
            purchases at shipping points, terminal markets, or intermediate
            points. Their typical type of operation is to negotiate a purchase
            on the buyer&apos;s instructions and authorization. Sometimes the
            broker negotiates the purchase without seeing the produce. In other
            instances he may select the merchandise after forming an appraisal
            of the quality of the produce being offered for sale on the market.
            Generally, a purchase is made in the buyer&apos;s name and the
            seller invoices the buyer direct. On the other hand, acting on
            authority given him by the 
            <PRTPAGE P='266' />
            buyer, the broker may negotiate purchases in his own name, pay the
            seller for the produce, make arrangements for its loading and
            shipment, and bill the buyer direct for the cost price plus the
            brokerage fee and the cost of any agreed upon accessorial service
            charges such as ice, loading, etc.

             The function of a broker is to facilitate good faith negotiations
            between parties which lead to valid and binding contracts. A broker
            who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied,
            in connection with any transaction is in violation of the Act, is
            subject to the penalties specified in the Act, and may be held
            liable for damages which accrue as a result of the violation. It
            shall be the duty of the broker to fully inform the parties
            concerning all proposed terms and conditions of the proposed
            contract. After all parties agree on the terms and the contract is
            effected, the broker shall prepare in writing and deliver promptly
            to all parties a properly executed confirmation or memorandum of
            sale setting forth truly and correctly all of the essential details
            of the agreement between the parties, including any express
            agreement as to the time when payment is due. The confirmation or
            memorandum of sale shall also identify the party who engaged the
            broker to act in the negotiations. If the confirmation or memorandum
            of sale does not contain such information, the broker shall be
            presumed to have been engaged by the buyer. Brokers do not normally
            act as general agents of either party, and will not be presumed to
            have so acted. Unless otherwise agreed and confirmed, the broker
            will be entitled to payment of brokerage fees from the party by whom
            it was engaged to act as broker. The broker shall retain a copy of
            such confirmations or memoranda as part of its accounts and records.
            The broker who does not prepare these documents and retain copies in
            its files is failing to prepare and maintain complete and correct
            records as required by the Act. The broker who does not deliver
            copies of these documents to all parties involved in the transaction
            is failing to perform its duties as a broker. A broker who issues a
            confirmation or memorandum of sale containing false or misleading
            statements shall be deemed to have committed a violation of 
            <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
              section 2 of
            </aref>
             the Act. If the broker&apos;s records do not support its
            contentions that a binding contract was made with proper notice to
            the parties, the broker may be held liable for any loss or damage
            resulting from such negligence, or for other penalties provided by
            the Act for failing to perform its express or implied duties. The
            broker shall take into consideration the time of delivery of the
            shipment involved in the contract, and all other circumstances of
            the transaction, in selecting the proper method for transmitting the
            written confirmation or memorandum of sale to the parties. A buying
            broker is required to truly and correctly account to its principal
            in accordance with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
              § 
              <subref title='7' part='46' sect='2' psec='#y_3' tq='N'>

              </subref>
            </aref>
            . The broker should advise the appropriate party promptly when any
            notice of rejection or breach is received, or of any other
            unforeseen development of which it is informed.

              Brokerage fees.

             A broker is not considered to be entitled to a brokerage fee unless
            he effects a sale or makes a valid and binding contract, fully
            performing his duties as a broker. Unless otherwise specifically
            agreed, the broker does not guarantee the performance of the
            contracting parties and is entitled to receive prompt payment of the
            brokerage fee whenever a valid and binding contract is negotiated.
            Brokerage fees may be charged to only one of the parties to the
            contract unless by prior agreement the parties agree to split the
            brokerage fee. If the brokerage fee is charged to both parties
            without a specific prior agreement, such action by the broker is a
            violation of the Act. A broker employed to negotiate the sale of
            produce may not employ another broker or selling agent, including
            auction companies, without the specific prior approval of his
            principal. When the broker is authorized to sell, invoice the buyer,
            collect and remit to his principal, he shall render an itemized
            accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment, showing
            the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees 
            <PRTPAGE P='267' />
            deducted, any auction charges and any other expenses incurred in
            connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account
            truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of
            the Act.

          <text>
             In the absence of a specific agreement, a broker is not responsible
            for payment to the seller by the buyer. Agreement to collect from
            the buyer and remit to the seller is not a guarantee by the broker
            that the buyer will pay for the produce purchased, unless there is a
            specific agreement by the broker that he will pay if the buyer does
            not pay. A broker who agrees to collect funds from the buyer for his
            principal shall render an itemized accounting to the principal
            promptly on receipt of payment showing the true gross selling price,
            all brokerage fees deducted and all expenses including auction
            charges, incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The
            failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment
            promptly is a violation of the Act. While the broker is not obliged
            to furnish his principal information regarding the financial
            condition of the buyer, if the broker furnishes such information, he
            must truthfully report the information available to him, and any
            false or misleading statements for a fraudulent purpose to the
            principal to encourage the sale will be a violation of the Act. A
            buying broker who negotiates a purchase in his own name under an
            agreement with his principal, is responsible for payment of the
            purchase price to the seller. A broker has no authority to grant
            allowances or adjust the seller&apos;s invoice price to the buyer
            without the specific prior approval of his principal.

             A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a broker and a

            parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents
            himself as a broker to the buyer or the seller when he is acting as
            a dealer purchasing produce or selling produce he has purchased, he
            shall be considered to have violated the Act. When a person
            purchases or sells produce as a dealer, he shall not request or
            receive a brokerage fee from the buyer or the seller. A broker shall
            not negotiate a transaction where the broker is subject to the
            direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other
            than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the
            direct or indirect control of the broker without fully disclosing

            approval.

          <text>
             Without prior consent of the owner, a broker has no authority to
            file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name. A
            broker has no obligation to file carrier claims for the owners of
            the shipments. However, when a broker in a transaction receives
            information valuable to the owner in connection with carrier claim
            rights, the broker should promptly advise the owner. A broker who
            agrees to protect the carrier claims of owners shall at all times
            exercise reasonable care to fulfill such obligation. If a broker
            makes an agreement with a seller or a buyer to file and handle such
            a claim for the benefit of the owner of the produce, the claim shall
            be filed promptly with the carrier, supported by adequate evidence,
            and he shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a
            conclusion. A copy of the claim shall be forwarded to the owner of
            the shipment when the claim is filed. When settlement of the claim
            is effected, the broker shall promptly remit the net amount due the
            owner, after deducting the agreed or customary charges for handling
            the claim. Adequate information shall be furnished the owner
            regarding the claim while the matter is being handled with the
            carrier. If the owner files the claim, the broker shall promptly
            furnish any necessary information available in his records which is
            requested by the owner.

            reasonable care and diligence in disposing of the produce promptly
            and in a fair and reasonable manner. A commission merchant engaged

            including auction companies, to dispose of all or part of such
            produce without the specific prior authority of the consignor. A
            commission merchant is not authorized to sell consigned produce
            outside the market area where he is located without obtaining the
            permission of the consignor. Averaging or pooling of sales is not
            permissible unless the receiver obtains the specific written
            permission of the consignor prior to rendering the accounting.
            Complete and detailed records shall be prepared and maintained by
            all commission merchants and joint account partners covering produce

            specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any

            commission merchant files a carrier 
            <PRTPAGE P='269' />
            claim on a consigned shipment, a specific agreement shall be reached
            with the consignor. If a commission merchant is authorized and
            agrees to file the claim, he shall forward a copy of the claim filed
            with the carrier to the consignor and shall exercise reasonable care
            to protect the interests of the consignor by filing the claim
            promptly and in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence,
            and shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a
            conclusion. When settlement of the claim is effected, he shall
            promptly remit the net amount due the consignor, after deducting the
            agreed handling charges. Full and complete information shall be
            furnished the consignor while the claim is being handled. If the
            consignor is to file the claim, the commission merchant shall
            exercise reasonable care to protect the claim rights of the
            consignor and shall promptly furnish all necessary information and
            evidence from his records to enable the consignor to file a proper
            claim. A joint account partner who files a carrier claim on behalf
            of the partnership shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the
            carrier to his partner, keep him advised of its status, and remit
            promptly his share of the net proceeds realized from such claim.

             The usual operations of shippers consist of purchasing produce from
            growers in their own names. They distribute the produce in commerce
            by selling, consigning, or jointing the shipments, assuming any loss
            or profits that result from these operations. In addition, shippers
            may handle produce on joint account with growers or others.

             Growers&apos; agents sell and distribute produce for or on behalf
            of growers and others and, in addition, may perform a wide variety
            of services, such as financing, planting, harvesting, grading,
            packing, furnishing labor, seed, containers, and other supplies or
            services. They usually distribute the produce in their own names and
            collect payment direct from the consignees. They render accountings
            to their principals, paying the net proceeds after deducting their
            expenses and fees. Some agents are limited by contract to making
            only sales and cannot joint or consign produce without obtaining the
            prior consent of the growers. Other agents are granted blanket
            authority by the growers to market and distribute the produce, using
            their discretion as to the best methods, depending on market
            conditions and the quality of the produce available. They can sell,
            consign or ship on joint account, use the services of brokers or
            sell through terminal market auctions. They are authorized to grant
            credits, make adjustments in the invoice price, handle claims with
            the carriers, or even abandon shipments, when circumstances justify
            such action, without consulting the growers. Some agents have an
            agreement with the growers to pool the produce and render
            accountings on the basis of the average or prorated selling prices
            after deducting the prorated expenses incurred for the various
            operations performed and the agents&apos; selling fees. Some
            agents&apos;s contracts require an accounting on the basis of actual
            selling prices after deducting the actual expenses incurred for
            services performed and the selling fees. Some agents&apos; contracts
            specify a fixed charge for harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing
            the container or other services, plus a selling fee, and thereby
            substantially reduce the record requirements necessary to prove the
            cost of the various operations.

             The responsibilities of shippers vary with their contracts with
            growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint account.
            Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend upon
            their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with
            dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce
            purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They
            shall fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint
            account transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or
            implied duty is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for
            any damages resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and 
            <PRTPAGE P='270' />
            maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of
            his transactions.

             When a shipper enters into a joint account transaction with growers

            both parties and the extent of the shipper&apos;s authority in

            records to show in detail the actual expenses incurred for the
            services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading, packing and
            selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by the
            parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of
            distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is

            account transaction, a lot number or other positive means of
            identification shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in
            order to segregate and identify the various lots of produce. If a
            shipper consigns all or part of the produce or employs the services

             The duties, responsibilities, and extent of the authority of a
            growers&apos; agent depend on the type of contract made with the
            growers. Agreements between growers and agents should be reduced to
            a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities
            of both parties and the extent of the agent&apos;s authority in
            distributing the produce. When such agreements between the parties
            are not reduced to written contracts, the agent shall have available
            a written statement describing the terms and conditions under which
            he will handle the produce of the grower during the current season
            and shall mail or deliver this statement to the grower on or before
            receipt of the first lot. A grower will be considered to have agreed
            to these terms if, after receiving such statement, he delivers his
            produce to the agent for handling in the usual 
            <PRTPAGE P='271' />
            manner. In the event an unsolicited lot of produce is accepted by an
            agent for handling in his usual manner, he shall promptly deliver or
            mail a copy of such statement to the grower. A copy of this
            statement, showing the name of the grower and the date the statement
            was delivered to the grower, shall be retained in the agent&apos;s
            files. An agent who does not have in his files either written
            contracts or a written statement as required herein is failing to
            prepare and maintain full and complete records as required by the
            Act.

             A growers&apos; agent whose operations include such services as the
            planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing of containers or
            other supplies, storing, selling or distributing produce for or on
            behalf of growers shall prepare and maintain complete records on all
            transactions in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and
            audited. Agents must be in a position to render to the growers
            accurate and detailed accountings covering all aspects of their
            handling of the produce. Agents shall maintain a record of all
            produce received in the form of a book (preferably a bound book)
            with numbered pages or comparable business records, showing for each
            lot the date received, quantity, the kind of produce and the name
            and address of the grower. Agents shall issue receipts to growers
            and others for all produce received. A lot number or other positive
            means of identification shall be assigned to each lot in order to
            segregate the various lots of produce received from different
            growers from similar produce being handled at the same time. Each
            lot shall be so identified and segregated throughout all operations
            conducted by the agent, including the sale or other disposition of
            the produce. The records shall show the result of all packing and
            grading operations, including the quantity lost through packing and
            grading and the quantity and quality packed out. If the culls are
            sold, they shall be included in the accounting. Unless there is a
            specific agreement with the growers to pool all various
            growers&apos; produce, the accounting to each of the growers shall
            itemize the actual expenses incurred for the various operations
            conducted by the agent and all the details of the disposition of the
            produce received from each grower including all sales, adjustments,
            rejections, details of consigned or jointed shipments and sales
            through brokers, auctions, and status of all claims filed with or
            collected from the carriers. The agent shall prepare and maintain
            full and complete records on all details of such distribution to
            provide supporting evidence for the accounting. If an agent is
            working under a pool agreement with growers, the accounting shall
            show how the pool cost and pool sales prices are computed. If the
            agent and the growers have agreed on a fixed charge to cover the
            various operations conducted by the agent, actual expenses incurred
            for these services covered by the agreement are not required to be
            shown in the accounting. The failure of the agent to render prompt,

            carriers by filing the claim promptly in the proper amount,
            supported by adequate evidence, and take any necessary action to
            bring the matter to a conclusion.

             means that the buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has
            no right of rejection. The buyer has recourse against the seller if
            the produce was not in suitable shipping condition (see definitions,
            paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section) or has recourse for a
            material breach of contract, providing the shipment is not rejected.
            The buyer&apos;s remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery
            of damages from the seller and not by rejection.

            tolerance can be applied to damage by condition factors. The

             A cumulative record of misrepresentation is maintained. It is used

            considered, and, if so, the amount of monetary penalty which is
            appropriate, or whether there is cause for instituting a formal
            disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or revocation of the
            violator&apos;s license. But after payment of a monetary penalty or
            after two years from the date of the last violation, no formal
            disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation.
            The record of misrepresentation shall be erased if there are no
            further violations in the twenty-four (24) month period immediately
            following the most recent violation, or after 36 months from the
            date of each individual violation unless it is involved in formal
            disciplinary proceedings.

            with 
            <PRTPAGE P='283' />
            paragraph (f) of this section. The responsibility for filing the
            notice to preserve the principal&apos;s rights is obligatory and
            cannot be avoided by the agent by means of a contract provision.
            Persons acting as agents also have the responsibility to negotiate
            contracts which entitle their principals to the protection of the
            trust provisions: 
            <E T='03'>
              Provided,

             That a principal may elect to waive its right to trust protection.
            To be effective, the waiver must be in writing and separate and
            distinct from any agency contract, must be signed by the principal
            prior to the time affected transactions occur, must clearly state
            the principal&apos;s intent to waive its right to become a trust
            beneficiary on a given transaction, or a series of transactions, and
            must include the date the agent&apos;s authority to act on the
            principal&apos;s behalf expires. In the event an agent having a
            fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or
            consignment of produce and remit such funds to its principal fails
            to perform the duty of preserving its principal&apos;s rights to
            trust benefits, it may be held liable to the principal for damages.
            A principal employing a collect and remit agent must preserve its
            rights to trust benefits against such agent by filing appropriate
            notices with the agent.
