          Tobacco in the forms in which it appears between the time it is cured
          and stripped from the stalk, or primed and cured, and the time it
          enters into the different manufacturing processes. The acts of
          stemming, sweating or fermenting, and conditioning are not regarded as
          manufacturing processes. Leaf tobacco does not include any
          manufactured or semimanufactured tobacco, stems which have been
          removed from leaves, cuttings, clippings, trimmings, shorts, or dust.

          leaves, floor sweepings, and all other tobacco materials (except
          stems) which accumulate in auction and storage warehouses, packing and
          conditioning plants, and stemmeries. Scrap which accumulates from

          which accumulates from handling stemmed leaf tobacco is known as
