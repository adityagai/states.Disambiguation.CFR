            contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 for on-site
            construction. It also applies to invitations for bids published for
            such construction. If construction work of over $10,000 is partially
            financed by another Federal Agency, the County Supervisor will try
            to reach an agreement as to which agency will administer the
            nondiscrimination requirements. If unable to reach an agreement, the
            County Supervisor will refer the case to the State Director.

          It is the current policy to sell all certificates of beneficial
          ownership to the Federal Financing Bank for financing activities from
          the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund and the Rural Development
          Insurance Fund. Sales from the Rural Housing Insurance Fund will be
          made to the Federal Financing Bank to the extent necessary to service
          certificates of beneficial ownership held by the Federal Financing
          Bank. Sales in excess of those needed for servicing requirements will
          be made to the public. In addition to sales, this subpart provides
          policy for the servicing of outstanding certificates of beneficial
          ownership, insurance contracts, and insured notes held by investors.

             The registration of all certificates owned by the same person,
            organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect to the
            name of the owner and, in case of fiduciary, the description of the
            fiduciary capacity. Individual owners should be designated by the
            names by which they are ordinarily known or under which they do
            business, preferably including at least one full given name. The
            name of an individual may be preceded by an applicable title, as,
            for example “Mrs.”, “Mr.”, “Miss”, “Ms.”, “Dr.”, or “Rev.”, or
            followed by a designation such as “M.D.”, “D.D.”, “Sr.”, or “Jr.”,
            Any other similar suffix should be included when ordinarily used or
            when necessary to distinguish the owner from another member of his
            family. The address should include, where appropriate, the name and
            street, route, or any other location feature, and zip code.
