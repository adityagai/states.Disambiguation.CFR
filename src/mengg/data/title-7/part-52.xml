          issued the original certificate after distribution of a certificate if

          After an appeal inspection has been completed, the lot(s) cannot be
          further appealed unless authorized by the Administrator. An appeal
          inspection certificate shall be issued, showing the results of such
          appeal inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection
          certificate previously issued for the processed product involved. Each
          appeal inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and
          date of the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded
          certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal
          inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality or
          condition of the processed product described therein. The inspector or
          inspectors issuing an appeal inspection certificate shall forward
          notice of such issuance to such 
          <PRTPAGE P='529' />
          persons as he considers necessary to prevent misuse of the superseded
          certificate if the original and all copies of such superseded
          certificate have not previously been delivered to the inspector or
          inspectors issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The provisions
          in the regulations in this part concerning forms and certificates,
          issuance of certificates, and disposition of certificates shall apply
          to appeal inspection certificates, except that copies of such appeal
          inspection certificates shall be furnished to all interested parties
          who received copies of the superseded certificate.

          person is to be licensed. Each such license shall bear the printed

                 When a standard sample size is not specified in the U.S. grade
                standards, the sample units for the various container size
                groups are as follows: Groups 1 and 2—1 container and its entire
                contents. Group 3 containers up to 10 pounds—1 container and its
                entire contents. Group 3 containers over 10 pounds—approximately
                three pounds of product. When determined by the inspector that a
                3-pound sample unit is inadequate, a larger sample unit or 1 or
                more containers and their entire contents may be substituted for
                1 or more sample units of 3 pounds.

          <text>
             The probability that a portion of production, with a given level of
            quality, will be accepted. In on-line sampling inspection, the
            probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on
            the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The
            probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures
            are the values which would be expected if a large number of sample
            units are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in these
            procedures, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality
            Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value (“S”)
            associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of
            acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection
            period as close as possible to 95 percent.

             A separate CuSum sampling plan is chosen for each class of defects
            (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL and then
            selecting the appropriate standard sample unit size. The quality
            levels associated with 50 percent and 10 percent probabilities of
            acceptance may be used as guides to help determine a suitable
            standard sample unit size.

             Tables XV through XIX contain the lot single sampling plans for
            each of five different standard sample unit sizes. The plans within
            each table are listed according to increasing values of Acceptable

             AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in “defects per

            plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for
            AQL values greater than 10.0.

            marks for this type of service is restricted to grade marks (with or
            without plain shield) and/or the statement “Inspected by the U.S.
            Department of Agriculture” (with or without plain shield). The
            official marks shall be similar in form and design as illustrated in
            figures 11 through 14. Failure to have all lots bearing official
            marks either inspected and certified or certified as produced in an
            approved plant shall cause the debarment of the user from receiving
            subsequent services, and such other actions as provided for in the
            Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.

          All inspectors and licensed samplers are forbidden, during the period
          of their respective appointments or licenses, to take an active part
          in political management or in political campaigns. Political
          activities in city, county, State, or national elections, whether
          primary or regular, or in behalf of any party or candidate, or any
          measure to be voted upon, are prohibited. This applies to all
          appointees or licensees, including, but not limited to, temporary and
          cooperative employees and employees on leave of absence with or
          without pay. Wilful violation of this section will constitute grounds
          for dismissal in the case of appointees and revocation of licenses in
          the case of licensees.

            sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the
            equivalent at 20 °C. (68 °F.), but without correction for invert
            sugars or other substances. The Brix measurement of the packing
            media may be determined by any other method which gives equivalent
            results.

             The drained weight of canned red tart pitted cherries is determined
            by emptying the contents of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8
            circular sieve of proper diameter containing eight meshes to the
            inch (0.0937 inch (2.3 mm), ±3 percent, square openings) so as to
            distribute the product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the
            product, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate
            drainage and allow to drain for two minutes. The weight of drained
            cherries is the weight of the sieve and product less the weight of
            the dry sieve. A sieve eight inches in diameter is used for No. 3
            size containers (404 × 414) and smaller, and a sieve 12 inches in
            diameter is used for containers larger than No. 3 size containers.

             The grade of frozen red tart pitted cherries is determined
            immediately after thawing to the extent that the cherries may be
            separated easily and the cherries are free from ice and solidified
            packing media. The grade is determined by considering in addition to
            the requirements of the respective grade (including the requirement
            of the size in U.S. Grade A and U.S. Grade B), the respective
            ratings of the factors of color, pits, absence of defects,
            character, the total score, and the limiting rules which may be
            applicable.

          Dates are the properly cured fresh fruit of the date tree (Phoenix
          dactylifera) which may or may not be softened by hydration. For the
          purposes of the standards in this subpart, dates, when referred to as
          “dry dates for processing,” means that the dates are dry and have not
          been softened by hydration.

             Except for U.S. Grade A or U.S. Fancy, the count-sizes of dried
            prunes are not incorporated in the grades of dried prunes. The
            count-sizes of dried prunes in this subpart refer to the count (or
            number) of prunes per pound of dried prunes. The various sizes of
            dried prunes for the respective varietal types are commonly
            designated as follows, but may be designated by other numerical
            expressions:

        <P>
          Dried prunes shall not exceed the moisture limits for the applicable
          grades and kind and size of packaging as designated in Table IV of
          this subpart except there is no moisture limit when safe and suitable
          preservatives have been added. “Moisture” means the percentage by
          weight of the finished dried prunes, exclusive of pits, that is
          moisture when determined by the Dried Fruit Moisture Tester Method or
          in accordance with methods that give equivalent results. The moisture
          limits in Table IV apply only to so-called “bulk packs” of dried
          prunes packaged in non-hermetically sealed containers holding 10
          pounds or more of dried prunes when safe and suitable preservatives
          have not been added. Such containers include, but are not limited to,
          wood boxes or fiber boxes.

             “Poor texture” means porous, woody, or fibrous flesh or immature
            prunes or prunes possessing flesh interspersed with excessive air
            pockets in which the texture of the flesh is noticeably different
            from the flesh of mature prunes which have been properly dried,
            handled, and processed. “Excessive air pockets” means that the
            prunes are affected by air pockets to the extent that the appearance
            and eating quality is seriously affected.

          Canned ripe olives are prepared from properly matured olives which
          have first been properly treated to remove the characteristic
          bitterness; are packed in a solution of sodium chloride, with or
          without spices, and are sufficiently processed by heat in hermetically
          sealed containers. Canned olives which are not oxidized in processing
          and which possess a tan to light bronze color indicative of
          preparation from olives of advanced maturity and commonly referred to
          as “tree-ripened” or “home-cured” are not covered by the standards in
          this subpart.

             Diameters of canned whole and pitted ripe olives are determined by
            measuring the smallest diameters at the largest circumferences at
            right angles to the longitudinal axes of the olives. The
            longitudinal axis is a line running from the stem to the apex of the
            olive.

          <text>
             The drained weight of canned ripe olives is determined by emptying
            the contents of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular
            sieve of proper diameter containing eight meshes to the inch (2.3 mm
            (0.0937 inch), ±3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the
            product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline
            the sieve at an angle of 17 degrees to 20 degrees to facilitate
            drainage and allow to drain for 2 minutes. The weight of drained
            olives is the weight of the sieve and product less the weight of the
            dry sieve. A sieve 20 mm (8 inches) in diameter is used for 
            <PRTPAGE P='582' />
            containers with total contents of 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) and less, and a
            sieve 30 mm (12 inches) in diameter is used for containers with
            total contents greater than 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs).
