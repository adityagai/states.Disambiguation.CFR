            2003 calendar years. Abandoned orchards and dead trees will not

            separations from other blocks of eligible trees and contain at least
            1,000 eligible trees or an entire orchard. Clingstone peach tree

            clingstone peach trees on the land cleared under this program
            through June 1, 2016. Participants bear responsibility for ensuring
            that trees are not replanted, whether by themselves, by successors
            to the land, or by any other person, until after June 1, 2016. If

            participants must refund all USDA payments, with interest, made in

            CCPA, and the Government Accountability Office at any reasonable
            time to inspect, examine, and make copies of such records and
            accounts to determine compliance with provisions of this part. Such
            records and accounts must be retained for ten years after the date
            of payment to the grower under the program, or for ten years after
            the date of any audit of records by USDA, whichever is later. Any
            destruction of records by the grower at any time will be at the risk
            of the grower when there is reason to know, believe, or suspect that
            matters may be or could be in dispute or remain in dispute.
