             The Rural Clean Water Program provides financial and technical
            assistance to private landowners and operators (participants) having
            control of rural land. The assistance is provided through long-term
            contracts (5 to 10 years) to install best management practices
            (BMP&apos;s) in project areas which have critical water quality
            problems resulting from agricultural activities. The proposed
            project area must be within a high priority area in an approved
            agricultural portion of a 208 water quality management plan.
            Participation in RCWP is voluntary.

          The RCWP is designed to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollutants
          to improve water quality in rural areas to meet water quality
          standards or water quality goals. The objective is to be achieved in
          the most cost-effective manner possible in keeping with the provision
          of adequate supplies of food and fiber and a quality environment.

             The Administrator, NRCS, through the State Conservationists, NRCS,
            is to enter into agreements, where practicable, with soil
            conservation districts, State soil and water conservation agencies,
            or State water quality agencies to administer all or part of the
            program for a project area. That portion of program administration
            to be conducted by these agencies will be defined in the project
            application and grant agreement. Where this is not practicable, USDA
            will administer the program in a project area. In those instances
            where USDA retains administration of the program in a project area,
            NRCS will enter into agreements for the transfer of funds to the
            Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) for the
            administration of part of the program.

             An adequate level of participation is reached when participants,
            having control of 75 percent of the identified critical area or
            source of the pollution problem in the project area, are under
            contract. Exceptions may be made where the approved agricultural
            portion of the 208 plan provides data and analyses which indicate
            that a greater or lesser percentage of the critical area or source
            treated is needed to attain water quality standards or water quality
            goals. Fifty (50) percent of the adequate level of participation is
            to be achieved within 3 years; the remainder within 5 years.

             An RCWP project area is a hydrologically related land area.
            Exceptions may be made for ease of administration, or to focus on
            concentrated critical areas. To be designated as an RCWP project
            area eligible for authorization, the area&apos;s water quality
            problems must be related to agricultural nonpoint source pollutants,
            including sediment animal waste, irrigation return flows, runoff, or
            leachate that contain high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus,
            dissolved solids, toxics (pesticides and heavy metals), or high
            pathogen levels. Generally, the project areas will be less than
            200,000 acres.

          The State Conservationist, NRCS, upon receiving notice of an approved
          project, is to enter into a grant agreement with the administering
          agency, except in those cases where USDA is to administer the program.
          When USDA retains administration, the State Conservationist, NRCS, is
          to enter into a fund transfer agreement with the State Executive
          Director, ASCS.

             Grant agreements detail the working arrangements and applicable

            written grant agreement identifying the parties involved, their
            responsibilities for carrying out the program, and the amount of
            program funds to be encumbered by NRCS is to be executed by the
            parties. This agreement is the fund obligating document. It also
            sets out the necessary working arrangements between parties for
            determining and allocating the administering agency&apos;s costs.
            All grants to administering agencies are to be in

            accordance with OMB Circular No. A-102, Department of the Treasury

            or local administering agency grants will be funded under
            Letter-of-Credit serviced by the U.S. Treasury Regional Disbursing
            Office, or by NRCS approved advance/reimbursement financing
            arrangements subject to the terms and conditions of the grant

             Grant agreements may be amended by mutural agreement of the parties
            to the agreement. NRCS may unilaterally amend agreements when the
            sole consideration is a change in the cost and the Administrator,
            NRCS, based on NRCWCC recommendations, determines that such an
            adjustment is necessary to carry out the program efficiently and
            effectively.

            208 water quality management plan. Such BMP&apos;s must reduce the

             Cost-share payments can be made by the administering agency after a
            participant has carried out a BMP or an identifiable unit of a BMP.
            Application for payment must be submitted to the administering
            agency, be certified by the NRCS or its designee, and be supported
            by such cost receipts as are required by the administering agency.
            It is the participant&apos;s responsibility to apply for payments.
