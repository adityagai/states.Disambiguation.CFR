             Recent changes in the telecommunications industry, including
            deregulation and technological developments, have caused Rural
            Utilities Service (RUS) borrowers and other organizations providing
            telecommunications services to consider undertaking projects that
            provide new telecommunications services and other telecommunications
            services not ordinarily financed by RUS. Although some of these
            services may not be eligible for financing under the Rural
            Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act), these services may
            nevertheless advance RE Act objectives where the borrower obtains
            financing from private lenders. The borrower&apos;s financial
            strength and the assurance of repayment of outstanding Government
            debt may be improved as a result of providing such
            telecommunications services.

             To facilitate the financing of new services and other services not

             The private lender is responsible for ensuring that its notes, for
            which an automatic lien accommodation has been approved as set forth
            in this section, are secured under the mortgage. The private lender
            is responsible for ensuring that the supplemental mortgage is a
            valid and binding instrument enforceable in accordance with its
            terms, and recorded and filed in accordance with applicable law. If
            the private lender determines that additional documents are required
            or that RUS must take additional actions to secure the notes under
            the mortgage, the private lender shall follow the procedures set

             RUS telephone borrowers are encouraged to utilize their own funds
            to participate in the economic development of rural areas, provided
            that such activity does not impair a borrower&apos;s ability to
            provide modern telecommunications services at reasonable rates or to
            repay its indebtedness to RUS and other lenders. When considering
            loans, investments, or guarantees, borrowers are expected to act in
            accordance with prudent business practices and in conformity with
            the laws of the jurisdictions in which they serve.
