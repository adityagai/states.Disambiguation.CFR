            expenses authorized by the Secretary for each marketing year. Each

            by the Secretary times the quantity of oil which the handler handles
            as the first handler thereof. The payment of assessments for the

            year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment as necessary

            oil handled during the applicable marketing year. In order to
            provide funds for the administration of this part before sufficient
            operating income is available from assessments, the Committee may

            credited toward assessments levied against the handler during the
            marketing year.

            persons prior to February 27, 1979. The terms of this contract shall

            of a class of oil from that producer&apos;s production at a specific
            price from a specified acreage and produced prior to 1982. The

          Whenever an allotment percentage has been established for a class of
          oil, each handler shall furnish to the Committee at least the
          following information for each lot of that class of oil acquired by
          the handler from a producer: (a) Name of producer; (b) name of
          handler; (c) class of oil acquired; (d) date of acquisition; (e) date
          when oil was produced; (f) net weight of oil in the lot; (g) quantity
          of that class of oil in the producer&apos;s annual allotment available
          for handler before this acquisition; and (h) quantity of oil remaining
          in the producer&apos;s annual allotment after this acquisition. This
          information shall be furnished in such manner as the Committee may
          prescribe. Upon acquisition the handler or the handler&apos;s agent
          also shall include the applicable information on the back of the
          producer&apos;s Annual Allotment Certificate, showing that the
          acquired oil was within the unused portion of the producer&apos;s

             Each year, the Committee shall determine the size of the minimum

            oil. The Committee shall include that information in its

            submit requests for allotment base. The Committee shall determine
            whether the new producers requesting additional base have ability to
            produce spearmint oil. The names of all eligible new producers from
            each region shall be placed in separate lots per class of oil. For
            each class of oil, separate drawings shall be held from a list of
            all applicants from Region A, from a list of all applicants from
            Region B, and from a list of all remaining applicants from Regions A
            and B combined. If, in any marketing year, there are no requests in
            a class of oil from eligible new producers in a region, such unused
            allotment base shall be issued to two eligible new producers whose
            names are selected by drawing from a lot containing the names of all
            remaining eligible new producers from the other region for that
            class of oil. The Committee shall immediately notify each new
            producer whose name was drawn and issue that producer an allotment
            base in the appropriate amount.
