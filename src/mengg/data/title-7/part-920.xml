             As his or her pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary
            finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee
            during a fiscal period, each person who first handles kiwifruit
            during such period shall pay to the committee, upon demand,
            assessments on all kiwifruit so handled. The payment of assessments
            for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required
            under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective
            of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become 
            <PRTPAGE P='128' />
            inoperative. If a handler does not pay any assessment within the
            time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to
            an interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established
            by the Secretary upon recommendation of the committee.

             The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each
            such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure
            sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during
            such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to
            approximately one fiscal period&apos;s expenses. At any time during
            or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of
            assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later
            finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be
            incurred:

            , must be limited to a maximum assessment rate of three and one-half
            cents per flat, or the equivalent thereof. The Secretary may
            increase this maximum rate in each succeeding year after the initial
            year of order operation by the Consumer Price Index (cost of living)
            for California as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Such
            increase shall be applied to all kiwifruit handled during the
            applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the
            administration of the provisions of this part during the first part
            of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available
            from assessments on the current year&apos;s shipments, the committee
            may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also
            borrow money for such purposes.

          , interest will be charged at a 1.5 percent monthly simple interest
          rate. Assessments for kiwifruit shall be deemed late if not received

          specified by the committee. A 10 percent late charge will be assessed
          when payment becomes 30 days late. Interest and late payment charges
          shall be applied only to the overdue assessment.
