             A program solicitation will be prepared and announced through
            publications such as the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register,
            </E>

          The Department may elect to solicit preproposals each fiscal year in
          order to eliminate from consideration proposed research that does not
          address narrowly focused program objectives. A preproposal will be
          limited in length (in comparison to a full proposal) to alleviate
          waste of time and effort by applicants in the preparation of proposals
          and USDA staff in the review of proposals. If the Department solicits
          preproposals through publication of the annual program solicitation,
          the Department does not anticipate publishing a subsequent
          solicitation for 
          <PRTPAGE P='445' />
          full proposals. Applicants submitting preproposals deemed appropriate
          to the objectives of this program as set out in the annual
          solicitation will be requested to submit full proposals; the full
          proposals will then be evaluated in accordance with

            cognizant authorized organizational representative who possesses the
            necessary authority to commit the applicant&apos;s time and other

            (80-character maximum), yet represent the major thrust of the
            project. Because this title will be used to provide information to
            those who may not be familiar with the proposed project, highly
            technical words or phraseology should be avoided where possible. In
            addition, phrases such as “investigation of” and “research on”

            eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in
            the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and
            procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the
            Director or Administrator as the effective date of the grant shall
            be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which
            the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for
            such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. It should be noted
            that the project need not be initiated on the grant effective date,
            but as soon thereafter as practicable so that project

            approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the

             This is an instrument by which NIFA or ARS agrees to provide small
            amounts of additional funding under a new or renewal grant as
            specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and may
            involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the
            project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award.
            A supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate
            completion of the original scope of work and if there is sufficient
            justification to warrant such action. A request of this nature
            normally will not require additional peer review.

            </head>
          </npcatch>
          <text>
             This is a funding mechanism whereby NIFA or ARS agrees to support a
            specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a
            statement of intention to provide additional support at a future
            date, provided that performance has been satisfactory,
            appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support
            would be in the best interests of the Federal government and the
            public. This kind of mechanism normally will be awarded for an
            initial one-year period, and any subsequent 
            <PRTPAGE P='451' />
            continuation project grants also will be awarded in one-year
            increments. The award of a continuation project grant to fund an
            initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an
            obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. Unless prescribed
            otherwise by NIFA or ARS, a grantee must subject a separate
            application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal year.
            Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate
            at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget
            period currently being funded. Decisions regarding continued support
            and the actual funding levels of such support in future years
            usually will be made administratively after consideration of such
            factors as the grantee&apos;s progress and management practices and
            the availability of funds. Since initial peer reviews are based upon
            the full term and scope of the original grant application,
            additional evaluations of this type generally are not required prior
            to successive years&apos; support. However, in unusual cases (e.g.,
            when the nature of the project or key personnel change or when the
            amount of future support requested substantially exceeds the grant
            application originally reviewed and approved), additional reviews
            may be required prior to approving continued funding.

          The Director or Administrator may elect to use a portion of available
          funding each fiscal year to support an Annual Conference, the purpose
          of which will be to bring together scientists and regulatory officials
          relevant to this program. At the Annual Conference, the participants
          may offer individual opinions regarding research needs, update
          information and discuss progress, or may offer individual opinions on
          areas of risk assessment research appropriate to agricultural
          biotechnology. The annual program solicitation will indicate whether
          funds are available to support an Annual Conference and, if so, will
          include instructions on the preparation and submission of proposals
          requesting funds from the Department for support of an Annual
          Conference. The Department may also elect to require principal
          investigators whose research is funded under this program to attend an
          Annual Conference and to present data on the results of their research
          efforts. Should attendance at an Annual Conference be required, the
          annual program solicitation will so indicate, and principal
          investigators may include attendance costs in their proposed budgets.
