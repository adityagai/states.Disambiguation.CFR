          sold as a result of the normal culling process are basic security
          unless the borrower has replacements that will keep numbers and

            will be taken as additional security when the County Supervisor
            determines in individual cases that it is needed to protect the

          Within 2 weeks after receipt of a written request from the borrower,
          the Agency must inform the borrower of the security and the total
          unpaid balance of the Agency indebtedness covered by the Financing

            for any loss caused the borrower and, in some States, other parties,
            and also may lose some of its security rights. The UCC provides that
            the borrower is entitled to such information once every 6 months
            without charge, and the Agency may charge up to $10 for each
            additional statement. However, the Agency provides them without
            charge.

            giving this information to others who have a proper need for it,
            such as a bank or another creditor contemplating advancing
            additional credit to the borrower.

             Chattel security will be inspected annually except in cases where
            the Agency official has justified in assessment or analysis review
            that no undue risk exists. An FO borrower who has been current with
            the Agency and who has provided chattels as additional security is
            an example of a case where an inspection may not be needed. All
            inspections will be recorded in the running record of the
            borrower&apos;s file. More frequent inspections should be made for
            delinquent borrowers or borrowers that have been indebted for less
            then 1 full crop year. The Agency official will discuss the

             The borrower must account for all security. When the borrower sells
            security, the property and proceeds remain subject to the
            Agency&apos;s lien until the lien is released. All checks, drafts,
            or money orders which the borrower receives for the sale of
            collateral listed on Form FmHA 1962-1 (available in any Agency
            office) must be payable to both the borrower and the Agency unless
            all Agency loan installments for the period of the form have been
            paid including any past-due installments. If the borrower disposes
            of collateral or uses the proceeds in a way not listed on Form FmHA
            1962-1, the borrower will have violated the loan agreement, and the
            Government will not release its security interest in the collateral.
            Releases of sales proceeds will be terminated when the
            borrower&apos;s accounts are accelerated.

             County Supervisors are authorized to approve or disapprove
            dispositions of Agency chattel security in accordance with this
            subpart. The County Supervisor, with the assistance of the borrower,
            will complete Form FmHA 1962-1 in accordance with the FMI (available
            in any Agency office) to show how, when, and to whom the borrower
            will sell, exchange, or consume security and use sale proceeds
            (include milk sale proceeds). Government payments, crop insurance
            and insurance proceeds derived from the loss of security will also
            be accounted for on Form FmHA 1962-1. This includes, for example,
            sale proceeds on hand and crops in storage. Only the proceeds from
            the sale of normal income security can be used to pay essential
            family and farm operation expenses. Proceeds from the sale of basic
            security will not be used for essential family living and farm
            operating expenses. In addition to payment of prior liens, basic
            security can only be released for the purposes listed in paragraphs
            (b)(2)(iv) through (b)(2)(vii). When proceeds from the disposition
            of normal income security are to be used to pay essential family
            living or farm operating expenses, County Supervisors must approve
            the disposition. Any disposition of basic or normal income security
            must be recorded on Form FmHA 1962-1. However, the borrower is
            responsible for providing the County Supervisor with the necessary
            information to update the Farm and Home Plan and Form FmHA 1962-1.

            Supervisor 
            <E T='03'>
              must
            </E>
             revise the Form FmHA 1962-1 contained in the borrower&apos;s case
            file, initial and date the change, and mark the form “Revised.” The
            County Supervisor will then either write to the borrower and send a
            copy of the “Revised” form to the borrower asking the borrower to
            date and initial the change and return the form to the county
            office, or the County Supervisor will ask the borrower to date and
            initial the change the next time the borrower is in the county
            office. Changes that would result in a major change (examples of
            major changes are: Feeder pig to sow operation, cow/calf to feeder
            steer operation, dairy to row crop, etc.) in a borrower&apos;s
            operation will always require a visit to the county office so that
            the County Supervisor and the borrower can complete a new farm and
            home plan and revise Form FmHA 1962-1. The County Supervisor will be
            responsible for determining if the requested change is major or not.

          The County Supervisor may use Form FMHA 462-12, to correct minor
          errors in a financing statement when the errors are not serious (i.e.,
          a slightly misspelled name). OGC will be asked to determine whether or
          not such errors are in fact minor. The County Supervisor may also use
          Form FmHA or its successor agency under

             Agency debts assumed will be repaid in amortized installments not
            to exceed 5 years using Form FmHA 1965-13. The Farm Credit Programs
            NP interest rate for chattel property set forth in a National Office
            issuance, in effect at the time of loan approval, will be charged.
            Any deferred interest not paid by the time the transfer takes place
            must be added to the principal balance. The transferred property,
            including EO property, will be subject to any existing Agency lien.
            In the absence of an existing Agency lien, new lien instruments will
            be executed.

            loan which was reduced or terminated in a manner that resulted in a

             The County Supervisor will obtain a current lien search report to
            determine the effect that liens of other parties will have on
            liquidation, the record lienholders to whom notices of sale will be
            given, and the distribution that will be made of the sales proceeds.
            Normally, lien searches should be obtained from the same source as
            is used when making a loan. If obtaining the searches from third
            party sources causes undue delay which interferes with orderly
            liquidation, searches may be made by the County Supervisor. If the
            lien search is made by third parties, the borrower will pay the cost
            from personal funds or if the borrower refuses, the agency will pay
            the cost and charge it to the borrower&apos;s account in accordance
            with the security instrument or EO Loan Agreement. The records to be
            searched and the period covered by the search will be in accordance
            with a State supplement.

            all security and EO property, except EO property that the County
            Supervisor determines is essential for minimum family living needs.
            The present market value of security that may be retained by the
            borrower for minimum family living needs will not exceed $600.
            However, only so much of the security and EO property will be
            liquidated as necessary to pay the indebtedness.

             A borrower may voluntarily liquidate chattels by selling the
            property at auction in the borrower&apos;s own name. RD 455-3,
            “Agreement for Sale by Borrower (Chattels and/or Real Estate)”, will
            be executed by the borrower, all lienholders, and the clerk of the
            sale or other person who will receive the sale proceeds before
            execution by the County Supervisor. When EO property is involved
            delete from the Agency lien wherever it appears on the forms. No
            Agency official is authorized to bid at such sales. The County
            Supervisor will arrange to promptly receive the proceeds of the sale
            due the Agency for application on the borrower&apos;s indebtedness.

            notice must be given to the District Director by registered or
            certified mail or by personal service before the sale. Also, the
            sale proceeds must be held for 30 days after the sale so that they
            may be claimed by IRS on the basis of its tax lien priority. In such
            perishable property cases, the proceeds or an amount large enough to

             Generally, probate or administration proceedings are started by
            relatives or heirs of the deceased or by other creditors.
            Ordinarily, the Agency will not start these proceedings because of
            the problems of designating an administrator or other similar
            official, posting bond, and paying costs. If probate or
            administration proceedings are started by other parties or at the
            Agency&apos;s request, and any security is to be liquidated by the
            Agency instead of by the administrator or executor or other similar
            official, it will be liquidated in accordance with the advice of
            OGC. The State Director may request OGC to recommend that the U.S.
            Attorney bring probate or administration proceedings when it appears
            that:

             Each secured claim will take its relative lien priority to the
            extent of the value of the property serving as security for it.
            These claims include those secured by mortgages, deeds of trust,
            landlord&apos;s contractual liens, and other contractual liens or
            security instruments executed by the borrower or real or personal
            property. However, tax, judgment, attachment, garnishment,
            laborer&apos;s, mechanic&apos;s, materialmen&apos;s, landlord&apos;s
            statutory liens, and other noncontractual lien claims may or may not
            be secured claims. Therefore, if any noncontractual claims are
            allowed as secured claims and the Agency claim is not paid in full,
            the advice of OGC will be obtained as to whether they constitute
            secured claims and as to their relative priorities.

             It may not be necessary to withdraw a claim when it is paid in full
            by someone other than the estate or when compromised. However, when
            it is necessary to permit closing of an estate, compromise of a
            claim, or for other justifiable reasons, the State Director will
            recommend to OGC that the claim be withdrawn on receipt of cash or
            security, or both, of a value at least equal to the amount that
            could be recovered under the claim against the estate. When the
            Agency keeps existing security, arrangements must be made to assure
            that withdrawal of the claim will not affect the Agency&apos;s
            rights under the existing notes or security instruments with respect
            to the retained security. In some cases, with OGC&apos;s advice, the
            claim may be properly handled without filing a formal petition for
            withdrawal of the claim. However, if the claim has been referred to
            the U.S. Attorney, or if a formal withdrawal of the claim is
            necessary, the matter will be referred by OGC to the U.S. Attorney.
