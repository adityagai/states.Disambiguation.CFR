             To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans under this
            part a producer must have the beneficial interest in the honey that
            is tendered to CCC for a loan. The producer must always have had the
            beneficial interest in the honey unless, before the honey was
            extracted, the producer and a former producer whom the producer
            tendering the honey to CCC has succeeded had such an interest in the
            honey. Honey obtained by gift or purchase shall not be eligible to
            be tendered to CCC for loans. Heirs who succeed to the beneficial
            interest of a deceased producer or who assume the decedent&apos;s
            obligations under an existing loan shall be eligible to receive
            loans whether succession to the honey occurs before or after
            extraction so long as the heir otherwise complies with the
            provisions of this part.

            consist of a storage structure located on or off the farm that is

            loan. Honey securing a loan must also be segregated from any honey
            not pledged as collateral for a loan that is stored in the same
            structure.

            where the honey is stored if the honey is stored at the

            loans at either the county office of the county where the storage
            facility is located or at the county office of the county where the
            producer&apos;s main place of business is located. A CMA must
            request loans at the county office for the county in which the
            principal office of the CMA is located unless the State committee
            designates another county office. If the CMA has operations in two
            or more States, the CMA must file its loan applications at the
            county office for the county in which its principal office for each
            State is located.
