             Through CSFP, the Department provides nutritious commodities to
            help State and local agencies meet the nutritional needs of
            low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants
            under one year of age, children who are at least one year of age but
            have not reached their sixth birthday, and elderly persons. Through
            local agencies, each participant receives a monthly package of
            commodities, based on food package guide rates developed by FNS,
            with input from State and local agencies. Food packages include such
            nutritious foods as infant formula and cereal, juices, canned fruits
            and vegetables, canned meat or poultry and other protein items, and
            grain products such as pasta, as well as other foods. Participants
            also receive nutrition education.

          <text>
             CSFP is administered at the Federal level by the Department&apos;s
            Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), which provides commodities,
            assigns caseload, and allocates administrative funds to State
            agencies. State agencies are responsible for administering the
            program at the State level. The State agency may select local
            agencies to administer the program in local areas of the State. The
            State agency must provide guidance to local agencies on all aspects
            of program operations. The State agency may also select
            subdistributing agencies (e.g., another State agency, a local
            governmental agency, or a nonprofit organization) to distribute or
            store commodities, or to perform other program functions on behalf
            of the State agency. Local or subdistributing agencies may also
            select other agencies to perform specific program functions (e.g.,
            food distribution or storage), with the State agency&apos;s
            approval. Although the State agency may select other organizations
            to perform specific activities, the State agency is ultimately
            responsible for all aspects of program administration.

          agencies; it is not intended to be all-inclusive.

             The State Plan is a document that describes how the State agency
            will operate CSFP and the caseload needed to serve eligible
            applicants. The State agency must submit the State Plan to FNS for
            approval. Once submitted and approved, the State Plan is considered
            permanent, with amendments submitted at the State agency&apos;s
            initiative, or at FNS request. All amendments are subject to FNS
            approval. The State Plan may be submitted in the format provided in
            FNS guidance, in an alternate format, or in combination with other
            documents required by Federal regulations. The State agency is
            encouraged to collaborate with the State WIC agency in developing
            the State Plan, for example, in developing plans for serving women,
            infants, and children, program outreach, and nutrition education.
            (Collaboration with the State WIC agency is required in preventing
            and detecting dual participation.) The State Plan must be signed by
            the State agency official responsible for program administration. A
            copy of the State Plan must be kept on file at the State agency for
            public inspection.

             The State Plan must be submitted by August 15 to take effect for
            the fiscal year beginning in the following October. FNS will provide
            notification of the approval or disapproval of the State Plan within
            30 days of receipt, and will notify the State agency within 15 days
            of receipt if additional information is needed. Disapproval of the
            Plan will include a reason for the disapproval. Approval of the Plan
            is a prerequisite to the assignment of caseload and allocation of
            administrative funds, but does not ensure that caseload and funds
            will be provided.

             The State agency must submit amendments to FNS to reflect any
            changes in program operations or administration described 
            <PRTPAGE P='464' />
            in the State Plan, and to request additional caseload for the
            following caseload cycle. FNS may also require that the State Plan
            be amended to reflect changes in Federal law or policy. The State
            agency may submit amendments to the State Plan at any time during
            the fiscal year, for FNS approval. The amendments will take effect
            immediately upon approval, unless otherwise specified by FNS. If a
            State agency would like to receive additional caseload for the
            caseload cycle beginning the following January 1, it must submit an
            amendment to the Plan which conveys the request for additional
            caseload by November 5. The State agency must also describe in this
            submission any plans for serving women, infants, children, and the
            elderly at new sites. FNS action on the State agency&apos;s request
            for additional caseload is part of the caseload assignment process,
            as described under

             Local agencies wishing to participate in CSFP must submit a written
            application to the State agency. The application must describe how
            the local agency will operate the program and, for nonprofit
            agencies, must include the agency&apos;s tax-exempt status. To be
            eligible to participate in CSFP, a nonprofit agency must have
            tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), or have
            applied for tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service
            (IRS), and be moving towards such status. Nonprofit agencies
            organized or operated exclusively for religious purposes are
            automatically tax-exempt under the IRC. Nonprofit agencies required
            to obtain tax-exempt status must provide documentation from the IRS
            that they have obtained such status, or have applied for it.

              What must the State agency do if a nonprofit agency approved for
              CSFP is subsequently denied tax-exempt status by the IRS, or does
              not obtain this status within a certain period of time?

          <text>
             In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the State agency
            may approve a nonprofit agency that has applied to the IRS for
            tax-exempt status, and is moving toward compliance with the
            requirements for recognition of tax-exempt status. However, if the
            IRS subsequently denies a participating agency&apos;s application
            for recognition of tax-exempt status, the agency must immediately
            notify the State agency of the denial. The State agency must
            terminate the agency&apos;s agreement and participation immediately
            upon notification. If documentation of recognition of tax-exempt
            status is not received within 180 days of the effective date of the
            agency&apos;s approval to participate in CSFP, the State agency must
            terminate the agency&apos;s participation until such time as
            recognition of tax-exempt status is obtained. However, the State
            agency may grant an extension of 90 days if the agency demonstrates
            that its inability to obtain tax-exempt status in the 180-day period
            is due to circumstances beyond its control.

            must remain subject to the eligibility criteria in effect at the

            percent, and 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines.
            The memorandum will reflect the annual adjustments to the Federal
            Poverty Income Guidelines issued by the Department of Health and
            Human Services. The State agency must implement the adjusted
            guidelines for elderly applicants immediately upon receipt of the

            the State agency must implement the adjusted guidelines at the same
            time that the State WIC agency implements the adjusted guidelines in
            WIC.

             No. The value of benefits received in CSFP may not be considered as

            purpose under Federal, State, or local laws, including laws relating
            to taxation and public assistance programs.

             No. The State agency must ensure that local agencies serve a CSFP
            participant, or WIC participant (if also eligible for CSFP), who
            moves from another area to an area served by CSFP, and whose
            certification period has not expired. The participant must be given
            the opportunity to continue to receive CSFP benefits for the
            duration of the certification period. If the local agency has a
            waiting list, the participant must be placed on its waiting list
            ahead of all other waiting applicants. The local agency that
            determined the participant&apos;s eligibility must provide
            verification of the expiration date of the certification period to
            the participant upon request.

             If applicants or participants, or the parents or caretakers of
            applicants or participants, commit program violations, the State
            agency may require local agencies to disqualify the applicants or
            participants for a period of up to one year. However, if the local
            agency determines that disqualification would result in a serious
            health risk, the disqualification may be waived. For program
            violations that involve fraud, the State agency must require local
            agencies to disqualify the participant from CSFP for a period of up
            to one year, unless the local agency determines that
            disqualification would result in a serious health risk. The State
            agency must require local agencies to permanently disqualify a
            participant who commits three program violations that involve fraud.

             FNS provides administrative funds to State agencies on a quarterly
            basis. Such funds are provided by means of a Letter of Credit,
            unless other funding arrangements have been made with FNS. The State
            agency obtains the funds by electronically accessing its Letter of
            Credit account.

            paragraph (a) of this section. However, in making its request, the

            amount at the State level, and must ensure that local agencies will
            not suffer undue hardship as a result of a reduction in
            administrative funds.

             Yes. FNS may recover and redistribute caseload and administrative
            funds assigned to a State agency during the fiscal year. FNS will
            redistribute these resources to other State agencies in accordance
            with the provisions of

            . In reassigning caseload, FNS will use the most up-to-date data on
            participation and the extent to which caseload is being utilized, as
            well as other information provided by State agencies. In accordance
            with

            , in instances in which FNS recovers caseload slots, the State
            agency must use 95 percent of its original caseload allocation to be
            eligible for additional caseload. However, the 
            <PRTPAGE P='474' />
            State agency must not exceed its reduced caseload allocation on an
            average monthly basis.

          </npcatch>
          <text>
             Yes. FNS will not unilaterally recover caseload that would result
            in the recovery of more than 50 percent of the State&apos;s
            administrative funds. However, in instances in which the State
            agency requests that FNS recover any portion of its assigned
            caseload, the 50-percent limitation will not apply.

             State and local agencies must maintain accurate and complete
            records relating to the receipt, disposal, and inventory of
            commodities, the receipt and disbursement of administrative funds
            and other funds, eligibility determinations, fair

            hearings, and other program activities. State and local agencies
            must also maintain records pertaining to liability for any improper
            distribution of, use of, loss of, or damage to commodities, and the
            results obtained from the pursuit of claims arising in favor of the
            State or local agency. All records must be retained for a period of
            three years from the end of the fiscal year to which they pertain,
            or, if they are related to unresolved claims actions, audits, or
            investigations, until those activities have been resolved. All
            records must be available during normal business hours for use in
            management reviews, audits, investigations, or reports of the
            General Accounting Office.

          <text>
             A fair hearing is a process that allows a CSFP applicant or
            participant to appeal an adverse action, which may include the
            denial or discontinuance of program benefits, disqualification from
            the program, or a claim to repay the value of commodities received
            as a result of fraud. State and local agencies must ensure that CSFP
            applicants and participants understand their right to appeal an
            adverse action through the fair hearing process, which includes
            providing written notification of the individual&apos;s right to a
            fair hearing along with notification of the adverse action. Such
            notification is not required at the expiration of a certification
            period.

             The State agency must establish simple, clear, uniform rules of
            procedure to be used in fair hearings, including, at a minimum, the
            procedures outlined in this section. The State agency may use
            alternate procedures if approved by FNS. The rules of procedure must
            be available for public inspection and copying.

             An individual, or an individual&apos;s parent or caretaker, may
            request a fair hearing by making a clear expression, verbal or
            written, to a State or local agency official, that an appeal of the
            adverse action is desired.

            However, if the hearing decision finds that a participant received
            program benefits fraudulently, the local agency must include the

            pending, as well as for any previous period, in its initiation and
            pursuit of a claim against the participant.

             If a hearing decision upholds the State or local agency&apos;s
            action, and a State-level review or rehearing process is available,
            the State or local agency must describe to the individual any
            State-level review or rehearing process. The State or local agency
            must also inform the individual of the right of the individual to
            pursue judicial review of the decision.

             The State agency must establish a management review system to
            ensure that local agencies, subdistributing agencies, and other
            agencies conducting program activities meet program requirements and
            objectives. As part of the system, the State agency must perform an
            on-site review of all local agencies, and of all storage facilities
            utilized by local agencies, at least once every two years. As part
            of the on-site review, the State agency must evaluate all aspects of
            program administration, including certification procedures,
            nutrition education, civil rights compliance, food storage
            practices, inventory controls, and financial management systems. In
            addition to conducting on-site reviews, the State agency must
            evaluate program administration on an ongoing basis by reviewing
            financial reports, audit reports, food orders, inventory reports,
            and other relevant information.

            within a reasonable period of time. To ensure improved program
            performance in the future, the State agency may require that local
            agencies adopt specific review procedures for use in reviewing their
            own operations and those of subsidiaries or contractors. The State

            preventing dual participation. In addition, with the consent of the
            participant, as indicated on the application form, the State or
            local agency may share information obtained with other health or
            welfare programs for use in determining eligibility for those
            programs, or for program outreach. However, the State agency must
            sign an agreement with the administering agencies for these programs
            to ensure that the information will be used only for the specified
            purposes, and that agencies receiving such information will not
