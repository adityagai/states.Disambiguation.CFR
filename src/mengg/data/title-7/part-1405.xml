             The term “crop of economic significance” means a crop that has
            contributed in the previous year, or is expected to contribute in
            the current crop year, 10 percent or more of the total expected
            value of all crops grown by the producer. However, notwithstanding
            the preceding sentence, if the total expected liability under the
            catastrophic risk protection endorsement is equal to or less than
            the administrative fee required for the crop, such crop will not be
            considered a crop of economic significance.

            violation to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, that
            person shall be considered ineligible for payments under the
            programs specified in paragraph (a) of this section that are funded
            by CCC for the same period of time for which, as determined by FCIC,
            the producer will be ineligible for crop insurance benefits of the
            kind referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Appeals of the
            determination of ineligibility will be administered under the rules
            set by FCIC.
