            commodities expected to be needed in order to meet the anticipated
            assistance at the local level, as determined by the distributing
            agency). Each commodity value shall be used consistently throughout
            the State to value commodities. The distributing agencies shall
            document and maintain on file for FNS review the method used to
            determine commodity values. Distributing agencies shall notify
            recipient agencies of the cost-per-pound used to value commodities
            at the time a commodity is offered to recipient agencies. If the
            cost used to credit a commodity differs from the cost used to offer
            a commodity, distributing agencies shall also advise recipient
            agencies of the cost used to credit a commodity. To value a
            commodity offered to a recipient agency and to credit a commodity
            towards a recipient agency&apos;s planned commodity assistance
            level, distributing agencies shall use one of the following: The
            actual cost-per-pound data used to charge a State&apos;s commodity
            entitlement; the estimated cost-per-pound data provided by the
            Department; or the USDA commodity file cost as of a specified date.
            Actual cost data shall be defined as the cost-per-pound for an
            individual commodity charged to a State&apos;s entitlement on the
            Entitlement Food Order Report, which is based on the USDA purchase
            cost. Estimated cost data shall be defined as the cost provided by
            USDA on commodity survey memoranda. The USDA commodity file cost
            shall be defined as the cost that is listed for a commodity as of a
            date specified by the distributing agency. For purposes of complying
            with OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and
            Non-Profit Organizations on inventory valuation, recipient agencies
            shall comply with guidance provided by the Food and Nutrition

            special needs of recipient agencies. Upon request by the recipient
            agency, the distributing agency may make deliveries less frequent

            service is not cost effective, due to distance or the size of a food
            order, or other necessary reasons, such as seasonal school closures.

            from a sample of at least 10 percent or 100 recipient agencies in
            each program category, whichever is less. To ensure that the sample
            is representative of all recipient agencies, distributing agencies
            shall consider the size and geographic location of all recipient
            agencies within the State and alternate among them so that over time
            each recipient agency is provided an opportunity to express its
            views. Distributing agencies are encouraged to extract information
            regarding commodity acceptability from all available sources.

          the distributing agency, if the distributing agency finds that: (i)
          The cause of the shortage cannot be established, (ii) the lost donated
          foods were held in non-
          <PRTPAGE P='548' />
          commercial storage or other facilities owned or operated by the
          distributing agency, a subdistributing agency or a recipient agency,
          and (iii) there is no indication that the loss was the result of
          negligence or continued inefficiency in operations, the distributing
          agency need not take any further claims action, but the factual basis
          for not taking further claims action shall be subject to review by the
          Department. Furthermore, distributing agencies shall not be required
          to file or pursue a claim for a loss which does not exceed an amount
          established by State law, regulations, or procedure as a minimum
          amount for which a claim will be made for State losses generally, but
          no such claim shall be disregarded where there is evidence of

          fail to pursue claims arising in their favor, or fail to provide for

          unless the Department determines that the distributing agency

             The distributing agency shall review the receipt and expenditures
            of funds annually to ensure that fund balances are not in excess of
            program needs. At a maximum, the operating account fund shall not
            exceed the sum of the previous year&apos;s highest three-month
            expenditures. Funds exceeding this maximum shall be considered in
            excess of program needs unless the distributing agency provides
            sufficient justification as to the need for such funds and receives
            approval from the FNSRO. FNSRO may determine that funds equal to or
            less than the expenditures for the previous year&apos;s highest
            three months are in excess of what is needed. In such instances, the
            distributing agency shall reduce the excess funds in the operating
            account by reducing distributing charges or returning the funds to
            the contributor. The salvage account will have no set limit. FNSRO
            must, however, give prior approval to each deposit to or expenditure
            from the salvage fund which is in excess of $2,500. The distributing
            agency shall impose upon subdistributing agencies and recipient
            agencies similar provisions for the use of such funds accruing from
            the operation of their programs.

            CPA (certified public accountant) audit for that year. Multi-State
            processors which receive $75,000 to $250,000 in donated food each
            year shall obtain an independent CPA audit every two years and those
            which receive less than $75,000 in donated foods each year shall
            obtain an independent CPA audit every three years. Those multi-State
            processors which are in the two or three-year audit cycle shall move
            into the next audit cycle at the point in time in which the value of
            donated foods received reaches $75,000 or $250,000 in any year. The
            total value of donated food received shall be computed by adding the
            value of food received under State and National Commodity Processing
            contracts. In instances in which the Department determines that the

            deficiencies, the processor shall be subject to additional audits at
            the request of FNS.

          These criteria will be reviewed by the appropriate FNSRO during the
          management evaluation review of the distributing agency. Distributing
          agencies and subdistributing agencies which enter into contracts on
          behalf of recipient agencies but which do not limit the types of end
          products which can be sold or the number of processors which can sell
          end products within the State are not required to follow the selection
          criteria. In addition to utilizing these selection criteria, when a
          contracting agency enters into a contract both for the processing of
          donated food and the purchase of the end products produced from the
          donated food, the procurement standards set forth in Attachment O to
          OMB Circular A-102 must be followed. Recipient agencies which purchase
          end products produced under Statewide agreements are also required to
          comply with Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102. Contracting agencies
          shall not enter contracts with processors which cannot demonstrate the
          ability to meet the terms and conditions of the regulations and the
          distributing agency agreements; furnish prior to the delivery of any
          donated foods for processing, a performance bond, an irrevocable
          letter of credit or an escrow account in an amount sufficient to
          protect the contract value of donated food on hand and on order;
          demonstrate the ability to distribute end products to eligible
          recipient agencies; provide a satisfactory record of integrity,
          business ethics and performance and provide adequate storage.

             Prior to donated foods being made available to a food service
            management company, the recipient agency must enter into a contract
            with the food service management company. The contract must ensure
            that all donated foods received for use by the recipient agency for
            a period specified as either the school year or fiscal year are used
            in the recipient agency&apos;s food service. Contracts between
            recipient agencies in child nutrition programs and food service
            management companies must also ensure compliance with other
            requirements in this subpart relating to donated foods, as well as

            pre-credit for donated foods. In pre-crediting, a deduction for the
            value of donated foods is included in the established fixed price
            per meal. However, the recipient agency must ensure that the food
            service management company provides an additional credit for any
            donated foods not accounted for in the fixed price per meal—e.g.,
            for donated foods that are not made available until later in the
            year. In cost-reimbursable contracts, crediting may be performed by
            disclosure; i.e., the food service management company credits the
            recipient agency for the value of donated foods by disclosing, in
            its billing for food costs submitted to the recipient agency, the
            savings resulting from the receipt of donated foods for the billing
            period. In all cases, the recipient agency must require crediting to
            be performed not less frequently than annually, and must ensure that
            the specified method of valuation of donated foods permits crediting
            to be achieved in the required time period. A school food authority
            must also ensure that the method, and timing, of crediting does not
            cause its cash resources to exceed the limits established in

            determined by an alternate means of the recipient agency&apos;s

            of the distributing agency, specify that the value will be the
            average price per pound for a food, or for a group or category of
            foods (e.g., all frozen foods or cereal products), as listed in
            market journals over a specified period of time. However, the method
            of determining the donated food values to be used in crediting must
            be included in procurement documents and in the contract, and must
            result in the determination of actual values; e.g., the average USDA
            purchase price for the period of the contract with the food vendor,
            or the average price per pound listed in market journals over a
            specified period of time. Negotiation of such values is not
            permitted. Additionally, the method of valuation must ensure that
            crediting may be achieved in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
            section, and at the specific frequency established in procurement
            documents and in the contract.

            centralized computer system. Before submitting orders for donated
            foods to FNS, the distributing agency must ensure that all school
            food authorities are aware of the full list of available donated
            foods, and have the opportunity to provide input at least annually
            in

            must ensure distribution to school food authorities of all such
            selected donated foods that may be cost-effectively distributed to
            them, and may not prohibit the use of split shipments in determining
            such cost-effectiveness.

             The school food authority should use donated foods, as far as
            practical, in the lunches served to schoolchildren, for which they
            receive an established per-meal value of donated food assistance
            each school year. However, the school food authority may also use
            donated foods in other nonprofit school food service activities.
            Revenues received from such activities must accrue to the school
            food authority&apos;s nonprofit school food service account. Some

             The school food authority should not use donated foods in meals or
            food service activities that do not benefit primarily
            schoolchildren, such as banquets or catered events. However, their
            use in such meals or activities may not always be avoided, e.g, for
            a school food authority utilizing single inventory management. In
            all cases, the school food authority must ensure reimbursement to
            the nonprofit school food service account for the value of donated
            foods used in such activities, in addition to reimbursement for
            other resources utilized from that account. Since school food
            authorities utilizing single inventory management cannot reimburse
            the nonprofit school food service account based on actual usage of
            donated foods outside of the nonprofit school food service, they
            must establish an alternate method—e.g., by including the current
            per-meal value of donated food reimbursement in the price charged
            for the food service activities.

             Prior to making distribution to agencies or households, the
            distributing agency shall submit a plan of operation for approval by
            the appropriate FNSRO. Such plans shall incorporate the procedures
            and methods to be used in certifying households in need of food
            assistance, in making distribution to households, and in providing a
            fair hearing to households whose claims for food assistance under
            the plan are denied or are not acted upon with reasonable
            promptness, or who are aggrieved by an agency&apos;s interpretation
            of any provision of the plan. No amendment to the plan of operation
            of the distributing agency shall be made without prior approval of
            FNS, and FNS may require amendment of any plan as a condition of
            continuing approval. The distributing agency shall require welfare
            agencies making distribution to households to conduct distribution
            programs in accordance with 
            <PRTPAGE P='575' />
            all provisions of the plan of operation. At a minimum, the plan

            donated foods under such contracts.

            Aging and their selected elderly nutrition projects, for use in
            providing meals to elderly persons. NSIP is administered at the
            Federal level by DHHS&apos; Administration on Aging (AoA), which
            provides an NSIP grant each year to State Agencies on Aging. The
            State agencies may choose to receive all, or part, of the grant as
            donated foods, on behalf of its elderly nutrition projects. The
            Department is responsible for the purchase of the donated foods and
            their delivery to State Agencies on Aging. AoA is responsible for
            transferring funds to the Department for the cost of donated food
            purchases and for expenses related to such purchases.

             In instances in which the President has declared a disaster and FNS
            has determined that, as a result of the disaster, low-income
            households are unable to purchase adequate amounts of nutritious
            food, disaster organizations (including agencies of State and
            Federal government) may be eligible to receive donated foods for
            congregate meal service or household distribution to disaster
            victims. Applications submitted by disaster organizations to the
            distributing agency for the receipt and distribution of donated
            foods in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this
            section shall be initially submitted in writing if circumstances
            permit and, if not, confirmed in writing in a timely manner. Both
            the applications and the written approval for the use of USDA
            commodities shall be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping
            requirements of this part.

             Distributing agencies may review and approve applications submitted
            by disaster organizations for the donation of foods for use in
            preparing congregate meals for disaster victims. Distributing
            agencies also shall determine the length of such donations, taking
            into consideration the magnitude of the situation, and may extend
            the duration of such donations as developing circumstances dictate.
            Following approval of a request for donated foods, the distributing
            agency shall make appropriate donated foods available from any
            source within the State to the disaster organization(s) and within
            24 hours of approving the application shall report the information
            listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the appropriate FNSRO.

            to victims of the situation of distress. Applications submitted to
            the distributing agency for the receipt and distribution of donated
            foods in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this
            section shall be initially submitted in writing if circumstances
            permit and, if not, confirmed in writing in a timely manner. Both
            the applications and the written approval for the use of USDA
            commodities shall be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping
            requirements of this part.
