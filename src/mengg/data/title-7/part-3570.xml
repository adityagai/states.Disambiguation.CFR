            that which accurately reflects the income of the population to be
            served by the proposed facility. The median household income of the
            service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income for the
            State will be determined using income data from the most recent
            decennial Census of the United States. If there is reason to believe
            that the census data is not an accurate representation of the median
            household income within the area to be served, this will be
            documented and the applicant may furnish, or the Agency may obtain,
            additional information regarding such median household income.
            Information will consist of reliable data from local, regional,
            State, or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable
            impartial source.

          authorize grant funds on a graduated basis. Eligible applicants
          located in smaller communities with lower populations and lower median
          household incomes may receive a 
          <PRTPAGE P='717' />

          a facility shall not exceed 75 percent of the cost of developing the
          facility.

             The State Director may assign up to 15 points to a project in
            addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (a) through
            (c) of this section. These points are to address unforeseen
            exigencies or emergencies, such as the loss of a community facility
            due to an accident or natural disaster or the loss of joint
            financing if Agency funds are not committed in a timely fashion. In
            addition, the points will be awarded to projects benefiting from the
            leveraging of funds in order to improve compatibility and
            coordination between the Agency and other agencies&apos; selection
            systems and for those projects that are the most cost effective.

             In selecting projects for funding at the National Office level,
            additional points will be awarded based on the priority assigned to
            the project by the State Office. These points will be awarded in the
            manner shown below. Only the three highest priority projects for a
            State will be awarded points. The Administrator may assign up to 30
            additional points to account for geographic distribution of funds,
            emergency conditions caused by economic problems, natural disasters,
            or leveraging of funds.

             In cases when preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible,
            high-scoring application is not feasible, or would require grant
            assistance exceeding 50 percent of a State&apos;s current annual
            allocation, or an amount greater than that remaining in the
            State&apos;s allocation, the approval official may instead select
            the next lower-scoring application for further processing provided
            the high-scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an
            opportunity to review the proposal and resubmit it prior to
            selection of the next application.

             Grants are sometimes made by Federal Regional Commissions
            (designated under Title V of the Public Works and Economic
            Development Act of 1965) for projects eligible for RHS assistance.
            RHS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to
            administering RHS assistance.

             The transfer of funds from a Federal Regional Commission to RHS
            will be based on specific applications determined to be eligible for
            an authorized purpose in accordance with the requirements of RHS and
            the Federal Regional Commission.

             The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is authorized under the
            Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 to serve the
            Appalachian region. ARC grants are handled in accordance with the
            ARC Agreement which applies to all ARC grants administered by Rural
            Development. Therefore, a separate Project Management Agreement
            between RHS and ARC is not needed for each ARC grant.

            grant or class of grants administered by RHS.
