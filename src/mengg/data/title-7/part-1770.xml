          summary account level used for reporting purposes for Class A
          companies, or in relation to total operating revenues or total
          operating expenses for Class B companies. For Class A companies, no
          correction in excess of one percent of the aggregate summary account
          dollars or one million dollars, whichever is higher, may be recorded
          in current operating accounts without prior approval. For Class B
          companies, no correction which exceeds one percent of total operating
          revenues or one percent of total operating expenses, depending on the
          nature of the item, may be recorded in current operating accounts
          without prior approval.
