            (ii) have exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain during the
            current calendar year. Exporters and elevator operators who are

            of the waiver, keep such accounts, records, and memorandum to fully

            export grain under this waiver. In the case of lots waived under
            this provision, if such lots are required by contract to be
            inspected or weighed, or if the lots are represented by official

          In the absence of prior adequate notice to appropriate official
          personnel, any action or practice, including the loading, weighing,
          handling, or sampling of grain that knowingly causes or is an attempt
          to cause the issuance by official personnel of a false or incorrect
          official certificate or other official form, is deemed to be deceptive
          and, as such, is a violation of 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            section 13(a)(3) of
          </aref>
           the Act. For the purposes of this paragraph, adequate notice is
          written or oral notice given to an agency or the Service, as
          applicable, before official personnel begin to perform official
          inspection or weighing services. If oral notice is given, it must be
          confirmed in writing within 2 business days. To be adequate, the
          notice must explain the nature and extent of the action or practice in
          question and must identify the grain, stowage container, equipment,
          facility, and the official personnel actually or potentially involved.

             The fees shown in schedules A and B apply to official inspection

            agencies in the United States, except for those State agencies that
            have been delegated additional responsibilities by FGIS. These
            States shall be assessed fees as set forth in the State&apos;s
            Delegation of Authority document. Failure of a delegated State or
            designated agency to pay prescribed fees within 30 days after being
            due, shall result in automatic termination of the delegation or
            designation. The delegation or designation shall be reinstated if
            fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred
            by the Service because of the termination are paid within 60 days of
            the termination.

            location (at other than a specified duty point) is more than 25
            miles from an FGIS office, the actual transportation cost in
            addition to the applicable hourly rate for each service
            representative will be assessed from the FGIS office to the service
            point and return. When commercial modes of transportation (e.g.,
            airplanes) are required, the actual expense incurred for the
            round-trip travel will be assessed. When services are provided to
            more than one applicant, the travel and other related charges will
            be prorated between applicants.

             The probability of accepting or rejecting portions of the lot
            during loading or unloading is dependent on inspection results
            obtained from preceding portions and the applied breakpoints and
            procedures. Breakpoints shall be periodically reviewed and revised
            based on new estimates of inspection variability. Tables 1 through
            24 list the breakpoints for all grains.

            export, grain after sampling or during unloading to inbound grain
            before sampling for the purpose of insect or fungi control, dust

             A reinspection or review of weighing service is limited to the kind

            resubmitted as a request for original services: Provided, however,
            that an applicant for service may request a reinspection of a
            specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or official
            criteria. In addition, reinspections for grade may include a review
            of any pertinent 
            <PRTPAGE P='459' />
            factor(s), as deemed necessary by official personnel. Official
            criteria are considered separately from official grade or official

            reinspection for official grade or official factors and official
            criteria may be handled separately even though both sets of results
            are reported on the same certificate. Moreover, a reinspection or
            review of weighing may be requested on either the inspection or
            Class X weighing results when both results are reported on a
            combination inspection and Class X weight certificate.

            criteria are considered separately from official grade or official
            factors when determining kind and scope. When requested, an appeal
            inspection for grade, or official factors, and official criteria may
            be handled separately even though both results are reported on the
            same certificate. Moreover, an appeal inspection may be requested on
            the inspection results when both inspection and Class X weighing
            results are reported on a combination inspection and Class X weight
            certificate.

            “gratuity” shall include any favor, entertainment, gift, tip, loan,

            of nominal value in a business or work relationship if the exchange
            is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; (2) the

            pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is wholly free
            of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the exchange
            of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal
            relationship (including those between official personnel and their
            parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the
            circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the
            family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work

            staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the

             The Service may, without first affording the organization an
            opportunity for a hearing, suspend an approval or refuse to
            reinstate an approval when the suspension period has expired,
            pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service
            has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the approval
            and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official
            weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended
            approval shall be effective when the organization receives a notice
            from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of
            a notice of such action, the Service shall give the organization an
            opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this
            section. The Service may terminate its action if it finds that
            alternative managerial, staffing, or operational arrangements
            satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the organization.
