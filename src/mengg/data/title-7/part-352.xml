            and any others which, in the opinion of the inspector, are necessary
            and are specified by him to prevent plant pest or noxious weed
            dissemination. In the case of prohibited or restricted products or
            articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for
            transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or
            for onward movement to the port of entry as residue cargo or under a
            Customs entry for immediate transportation, this shall include
            necessary safeguards with respect to any movement within the port
            area between the point of arrival and the point of temporary
            storage, other handling, or point of departure, including a foreign
            trade zone. Prohibited and restricted products and articles subject

            exportation or transportation and exportation, or for onward
            movement as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate
            transportation, shall be transshipped, or transported and exported
            from the United States, or moved onward immediately. This shall mean
            the shortest practicable interval of time commensurate with the risk
            of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination required to transfer the
            products or articles from one carrier to another and to move them
            onward or from the United States. If, in the opinion of the
            inspector, considerations of risk of plant pest or noxious weed
            dissemination require, such movement shall be made without regard to
            the noncompetitive or competitive relations of the carriers
            concerned, and the inspector shall promptly report to the Plant
            Protection and Quarantine Programs the circumstances when the
            emergency is so acute that subsequent movement is required on a
            carrier of a company other than the one bringing the products or
            articles to the United States or on which onward movement was
            contemplated by the shipper or forwarding carrier. Prohibited or

             and this part shall be considered. The safeguards prescribed shall
            be the minimum required to prevent plant pest or noxious weed
            dissemination. Destruction or exportation shall be required only
            when no less drastic measures are deemed by the inspector to be
            adequate to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination. The
            inspector may follow administrative instructions promulgated for
            certain situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him
            from administratively approved methods known to be effective in
            similar situations. In the case of aircraft that are contaminated
            with insect pests, only an insecticidal formulation, approved for
            use in aircraft, may be so applied as an emergency measure. If the
            application is not effective against the insect pests or if other
            pests must be safeguarded against, the inspector shall report the
            circumstances promptly to the Plant Protection and Quarantine
            Programs and receive instructions as to safeguards that will not
            have a deleterious effect on the structure of the aircraft or its
            operating equipment. In prescribing safeguards consideration will be

            port of exit or to an approved North Atlantic port in the United
            States for export to another foreign country, as follows: The fruit

            to Galveston, TX, to Kinder, LA, to Memphis, TN, and then to

            diversion en route, for reentry into Mexico.
