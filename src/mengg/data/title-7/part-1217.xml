             In the event that any HTSUS number subject to assessment is changed
            and such change is merely a replacement of a previous number and has
            no impact on the description of the softwood lumber involved,

            may impose a late payment charge and interest. The late payment

             Domestic manufacturers who ship less than 15 million board feet of
            softwood lumber within the United States in a fiscal year are exempt
            from paying assessments. Such manufacturers must apply to the Board,
            on a form provided by the Board, for a certificate of exemption
            prior to the start of the fiscal year. This is an annual exemption
            and domestic manufacturers must reapply each year. Such
            manufacturers shall certify that they will ship less than 15 million
            board feet of softwood lumber during the fiscal year for which the
            exemption is claimed. Upon receipt of an application for exemption,
            the Board shall determine whether an exemption may be granted. The
            Board may request past shipment data to support the exemption
            request. The Board will then issue, if deemed appropriate, a
            certificate of exemption to the eligible domestic manufacturer. It
            is the responsibility of the domestic manufacturer to retain a copy
            of the certificate of exemption.

            is the responsibility of the importer to retain a copy of the
            certificate of exemption. The importer may be requested to submit a
            copy of the certificate to Customs. If Customs collects the
            assessment, the Board shall refund such importers their assessments
            no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of such assessments by
            the Board. No interest shall be paid on the assessments collected by
            Customs.

            To obtain an organic exemption, an eligible domestic manufacturer

            manufacturer&apos;s name and address; a copy of the organic
            operation certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent
            as defined in the Organic Act, a signed certification that the

            30 calendar days to approve the exemption request. If the exemption
            is not granted, the Board will notify the applicant and provide

             An importer who imports only softwood lumber that is eligible to be
            labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP and is not a split
            operation shall be exempt from the payment of assessments. To obtain
            an organic exemption, an eligible importer must submit documentation
            to the Board and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent
            of organic softwood lumber, on a form provided by the Board, at any
            time initially and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of
            the fiscal year as long as the importer continues to be eligible for
            the exemption. This documentation shall include the same information
            as required by domestic manufacturers in paragraph (d)(2) of this
            section. If the importer complies with the requirements of this
            section, the Board will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate
            of Exemption to the importer. The Board will also issue the importer
            a 9-digit alphanumeric number valid for 1 year from the date of
            issue. This alphanumeric number should be entered by the importer to
            Customs at entry summary. Any line item entry of 100 percent organic
            softwood lumber bearing this alphanumeric number assigned by the
            Board will not be subject to assessments.

            collected by Customs and may apply to the Board for a reimbursement.
            The importer would be required to submit satisfactory proof to the
            Board that the importer paid the assessment on exempt organic
            products.
