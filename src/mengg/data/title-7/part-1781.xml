            maintaining watershed works of improvement must be agreed upon by
            sponsoring local organizations and NRCS. When approved, it is the
            basis for extending technical and cost sharing assistance from
            watershed funds. The RCD area plan is prepared for the development
            of the RCD area by sponsoring local organizations with assistance
            from NRCS and other agencies, endorsed by the Governor or by the
            agency designated by the Governor, and accepted by the Secretary of
            Agriculture or his delegate. It includes objectives, planned courses
            of action, and RCD measures or projects to be developed. It is
            amended as necessary to include continuing activities and needs in
            the RCD area.

             For loans, unless otherwise required by State law, interest will
            accrue from date of check delivery where Form RD 440-22, “Promissory
            Note (Association Organization),” is used. Where bonds are used
            interest will accrue from the applicable dates recorded on the
            bonds. Where multiple loan disbursements are used interest will
            accrue from date of check.

             In cases where the indebtedness will be represented by serial bonds
            or a single bond having installments of principal plus interest,
            stated separately, annual payments of principal and interest will be
            scheduled to permit them to be paid in amounts approximately equal
            to the amounts that would be required for annual amortized
            installments.

             If the borrower will be retiring other debts represented by bonds
            or notes, the payment on such bonds may be considered in developing
            the payment schedule for the RUS loan. In some cases, it may be
            desirable to reduce the amount of payments to RUS in the early years
            of the loan in order to preclude the necessity for refinancing the
            outstanding debt. When such payment schedules are proposed, National
            Office authorization will be obtained prior to loan approval.

             Insofar as loan payments are consistent with income availability,
            applicable State statutes, and commercial customs in the preparation
            of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness, they should be scheduled
            on a monthly basis either in the bond 
            <PRTPAGE P='339' />
            or other evidence of indebtedness or through the use of a
            supplemental agreement. Such requirements will be accomplished not
            later than the time of loan closing. When monthly payments are
            required, such payments will be scheduled beginning one full month
            following the date of loan closing or the end of any approved
            deferment period. Subsequent monthly payments will be scheduled each
            full month thereafter. In those cases where evidence of indebtedness
            calls for annual or semiannual payments, they will be scheduled
            beginning six or twelve full months, respectively following the date
            of loan closing or the end of any approved deferment period.
            Subsequent payments will be scheduled each sixth or twelfth full
            month respectively, thereafter. When the evidence of indebtedness is
            dated the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month, the payment date will
            be scheduled the 28th day of the month.

            advance needed and whether a request for it has been made to NRCS.
            The Rural Development State Director and the NRCS State
            Conservationist will coordinate applicable processing actions of
            such applications. When the Rural Development State Director
