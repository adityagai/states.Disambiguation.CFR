             Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted
            by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a
            governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A
            person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal
            financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal
            programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in
            a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect. The Board
            shall review the List of Debarred entities prior to making final
            loan Guarantee decisions. Suspension or debarment may be a basis for
            denying a loan Guarantee.

             The date of receipt for any request, including one that is
            addressed incorrectly or that is referred to the Board by another
            agency, is the date the Secretary of the Board actually receives the
            request. The Secretary of the Board shall normally process requests
            in the order they are received. However, in the Secretary of the
            Board&apos;s discretion, the Board may use two or more processing
            tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests
            based on the number of pages involved, or some other measure of the
            amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, and
            whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described
            in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. When using multitrack
            processing, the Secretary of the Board may provide requesters in the
            slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their
            requests in order to qualify for faster processing. The Secretary of
            the Board shall contact the requester by telephone or by letter,
            whichever is most efficient in each case.

            administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied.

             A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, solely

            reasonably believes that a requester is separating a request into a
            series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees
            or that several requesters appear to be acting together to submit
            multiple requests solely in order to avoid payment of fees, the
            Secretary of the Board may aggregate such requests and charge
            accordingly. It is considered reasonable for the Secretary of the
            Board to presume that multiple requests by one requester on the same
            topic made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.

             The notice given to the submitter by mail, return receipt
            requested, shall be given as soon as practicable after receipt of
            the request for access, and shall describe the request and provide
            the submitter seven working days from the date of notice, to submit
            written objections to disclosure of the information. Such statement
            shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information and
            shall demonstrate why the information which is considered to be
            commercial or financial information, and that the information is a
            trade secret, is privileged or confidential, or that its disclosure
            is likely to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter. If
            the submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time
            specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to
            the release of the information. Information a submitter provides
            under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the
            FOIA.
