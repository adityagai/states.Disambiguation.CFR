          In Fiscal Year 2004, applications will be accepted for this RFP grant
          program from October 6, 2004, until December 6, 2004, at which time
          the initial application period shall close. An applicant may withdraw,
          substitute, amend or supplement its application at any time prior to
          the closing of the initial application period. Once the initial
          application period has closed, all applications shall be considered
          final. For subsequent fiscal years, if any funds for this program are
          available, the Secretary will publish a notice to that effect. The
          notice will establish the period during which applications for such
          funds may be submitted for consideration.
