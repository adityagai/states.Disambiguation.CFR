             The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was established by
            Executive Order No. 7037 on May 11, 1935. Statutory authority was
            provided by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) (
            <aref type='USC'>

            ). The RE Act established REA as a lending agency with
            responsibility for developing a program for rural electrification.

             On October 28, 1949, the RE Act was amended to authorize REA to
            make loans to improve and extend telephone service in rural areas.
            The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB), an agency of the United States, was
            established by amendment to the RE Act, approved May 7, 1971. The
            Administrator of RUS serves as the Bank&apos;s chief executive with
            the title of Governor.

             The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) established the Rural

            telecommunications loan and loan guarantee programs previously
            administered by REA, including programs of the Rural Telephone Bank
            (RTB), and water and waste loans and grants previously administered
            by the Rural Development Administration, along with other functions
            as the Secretary determined appropriate. The rights, interests,
            obligations, duties, and contracts previously vested in REA were
            transferred to, and vested in RUS.

             Eligibility for succession to the position of RUS Administrator
            shall be limited to officially assigned incumbents of positions
            listed in paragraph (b) of this section. Only officials specifically
            designated in the approved order of succession are eligible. Persons
            appointed on acting basis, or on some other temporary basis, are
            ineligible by virtue of so serving to serve as a successor.
            Therefore the order of succession would fall to the next designated
            official in the approved order of succession. The eligibility of the
            incumbent of paragraph (b)(6) of this section to serve as a
            successor is also limited to periods of national emergency declared
            by the President or during the activation of the RUS COOP plan.

            Administrator, including those functions and duties that are

            Administrator and the Deputy Administrator, or in the event that
            both the office of Administrator and Deputy Administrator are
            vacant, the officials in the order of succession indicated in
            paragraph (b) of this section shall perform all the functions and

            Administrator.

             In considering a request for a non-duplication waiver, the
            Administrator will consider the offerings of all existing service

            waiver is warranted. A waiver of non-duplication restrictions will
            not be given if the Administrator determines as a matter of
            financial feasibility that, taking into account all existing service
            providers, an applicant or RUS borrower would not be able to repay a
