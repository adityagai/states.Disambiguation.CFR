             Occasionally, NIFA will issue a program announcement (PA) to alert
            potential applicants and the public about new and ongoing funding
            opportunities. These PAs may provide tentative due dates and are
            released without associated application packages. Hence, no
            applications are solicited under a PA. PAs are announced in the

             or on the NIFA Web site.

             NIFA may request or require that prospective applicants notify
            program staff of their intent to submit an application, identified
            as “letter of intent”. If applicable, the request or requirement
            will be included in the RFA, along with directions for the
            preparation and submission of the letter of intent, the type of
            letter of intent, and any relevant deadlines. There are two types of
            letters of intent: optional and required.

             Entities interested in submitting an application for a NIFA award
            should complete and submit a “Letter of Intent to Submit an
            Application” by the due date specified in the RFA. This does not
            obligate the applicant in any way, but will provide useful
            information to NIFA in preparing for application review. Applicants
            that do not submit a letter of intent by the specified due date are
            still allowed to submit an application by the application due date
            specified in the RFA, unless otherwise specified in the RFA.

             Certain programs may require that the prospective applicants submit
            a letter of intent for specific programs. This type of letter is
            evaluated by the program staff for suitability to the program and in
            regard to program priorities, needs, and scope. Invitations to
            submit a full application will be issued by the Program Officer or
            his or her representative. For programs requiring a letter of
            intent, applications submitted without prior approval of the letter
            of intent by the program staff will be returned without review.
            Programs requiring a specific letter of intent will be specified in
            the RFA.

             In addition to program-specific eligibility requirements, awards
            will be made only to responsible applicants. Specific management
            information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on a
            one-time basis, with updates on an as-needed basis, as part of the
            responsibility determination prior to an award being made under a
            specific NIFA program, if such information has not been provided
            previously under this or another NIFA program. NIFA will provide
            copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling these requirements
            as part of the pre-award process. Although an applicant may be
            eligible based on its status as one of these entities, there are
            factors that may exclude an applicant from receiving Federal
            financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under a NIFA
            program (e.g., debarment or suspension of an individual involved or
            a determination that an applicant is not responsible based on
            submitted organizational management information).

          The RFA provides instructions on how to access a funding opportunity.
          The funding opportunity contains the application package, which
          includes the forms necessary for completion of an application in
          response to the RFA, as well as the application instructions. The
          application instructions document, “NIFA Grants.gov Application Guide:
          A Guide for Preparation and Submission of NIFA Applications via
          Grants.gov,” is intended to assist applicants in the preparation and
          submission of applications to NIFA. It is also the primary document
          for use in the preparation of NIFA applications via Grants.gov.

             The RFA will provide deadlines for the submission of letters of

            separate RFAs and/or establish separate deadlines for different
            types of applications, different award instruments, or different
            topics or phases of the Federal assistance programs. If applications
            are not received by applicable deadlines, they will not be
            considered for funding. Exceptions will be considered only when
            extenuating circumstances exist, as determined by NIFA, and
            justification and supporting documentation are provided to NIFA.

             The inclusion of proprietary information is discouraged unless it
            is necessary for the proper evaluation of the application. If
            proprietary information is to be included, it should be limited, set
            apart from other text on a separate page, and keyed to the text by
            numbers. It should be confined to a few critical technical items
            that, if disclosed, could jeopardize the obtaining of foreign or
            domestic patents. Trade secrets, salaries, or other information that
            could jeopardize commercial competitiveness should be similarly
            keyed and presented on a separate page. Applications or reports that
            attempt to restrict dissemination of large amounts of information
            may be found unacceptable by the Department and constitute grounds
            for return of the application without further consideration. Without
            assuming any liability for inadvertent disclosure, the Department
            will limit dissemination of such information to its employees and,
            where necessary for the evaluation of the application, to outside
            reviewers on a confidential basis. An application may be withdrawn
            at any time prior to the final action thereon.

        <P>
          The guiding principle for Federal assistance application review and
          evaluation is to ensure that each proposal is treated in a consistent
          and fair manner regardless of regional and institutional affiliation.
          After the evaluation process by the review panel, NIFA, through the
          program officer, ensures that applicants receive appropriate feedback
          and comments on their proposals, and processes the awards in as timely
          a manner as possible.

          set forth in the RFA. Applications that do not meet the administrative
          requirements may be eliminated from program competition. However, NIFA
          retains the right to conduct discussions with applicants to resolve
          technical and/or budget issues, as deemed necessary by NIFA.

          NIFA may implement appropriate business processes to minimize or
          eliminate the awarding of NIFA Federal assistance that unnecessarily
          duplicates activities already being sponsored under other awards,
          including awards made by other Federal agencies. Business processes
          may include the review of the Current and Pending Support Form;
          documented CRIS searches prior to award; the conduct of PD workshops,
          conferences, meetings, and symposia; and agency participation in
          Federal Government-wide and other committees, taskforces, or groups
          that seek to solve problems related to agricultural research,
          education, and extension and other activities delegated to the NIFA
          Director.

             Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the NIFA ADO
            shall make Federal assistance awards to those responsible, eligible
            applicants whose applications are judged most meritorious under the
            procedures set forth in the RFA. The date specified by the NIFA ADO
            as the effective date of the award shall be no later 
            <PRTPAGE P='470' />
            than September 30th of the Federal fiscal year in which the project
            is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose,
            unless otherwise permitted by law. It should be noted that the
            project need not be initiated on the award effective date, but as
            soon thereafter as practical so that project goals may be attained
            within the funded project period. All funds awarded by NIFA shall be
            expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are awarded in
            accordance with the approved application and budget, the
            regulations, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable
            Federal cost principles, and the Department&apos;s assistance

             Indirect costs may be claimed under the Federal portion of the
            award budget or, alternatively, indirect costs may be claimed as a
            matching contribution (if no indirect costs are requested under the
            Federal portion of the award budget). However, unless explicitly
            authorized in the RFA, indirect costs may not be claimed on both the
            Federal portion of the award budget and as a matching contribution,
            unless the total claimed on both the Federal portion of the award
            budget and as a matching contribution does not exceed the maximum
            allowed indirect costs or the institution&apos;s negotiated indirect
            cost rate, whichever is less. An awardee may split the allocation
            between the Federal and non-Federal portions of the budget only if
            the total amount of indirect costs charged to the project does not
            exceed the maximum allowed indirect costs or the institution&apos;s
            negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is less. For example, if an
            awardee&apos;s indirect costs are capped at 22 percent pursuant to

          In addition to reviewing (and monitoring the status of) progress and
          final technical reports and financial reports, NIFA Program Officers
          may use regular and periodic conference calls to monitor the
          awardee&apos;s performance as well as PD conferences, workshops,
          meetings, and symposia to not only monitor the awards, but to
          facilitate communication and the sharing of project results. These
          opportunities also serve to eliminate or minimize NIFA funding
          unneeded duplicative project activities. Required attendance at these
          conference calls, conferences, workshops, meetings, and symposia 
          <PRTPAGE P='474' />
          will be identified in the RFA and the awardee should develop a

             If an awardee has failed to materially comply with the terms and

            including, but not limited to, suspending the award pending
            corrective action, terminating the award for cause, and withholding
            of support.

             NIFA generally will suspend (rather than immediately terminate) an
            award to allow the awardee an opportunity to take appropriate
            corrective action before NIFA makes a termination decision. NIFA may
            decide to terminate the award if the awardee does not take
            appropriate corrective action during the period of suspension. NIFA
            may terminate, without first suspending, the award if the deficiency
            is so serious as to warrant immediate termination. Termination for
            cause may be appealed under the NIFA award appeals procedures
            specified in

             An award also may be terminated, partially or wholly, by the
            awardee or by NIFA with the consent of the awardee. If the awardee
            decides to terminate a portion of the award, NIFA may determine that
            the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes
            for which the award was originally made. In any such case, NIFA will
            advise the awardee of the possibility of termination of the entire
            award and allow the awardee to withdraw its termination request. If
            the awardee does not withdraw its request for partial termination,
            NIFA may initiate procedures to terminate the entire award for
            cause.

          <text>
             Withholding of support is a decision not to make a non-competing
            continuation award within the current competitive segment. Support
            may be withheld for one or more of the following reasons: Adequate
            Federal funds are not available to support the project; an awardee
            failed to show satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of
            the project; an awardee failed to meet the terms and conditions of a
            previous award; or for whatever reason, continued funding would not
            be in the best interests of the Federal Government. If a
            non-competing continuation award is denied (withheld) because the
            awardee failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a previous
            award, the awardee may appeal that determination under

            appealing an adverse determination, the awardee must submit a
            request for review to the NIFA official specified in the
            notification, detailing the nature of the disagreement with the
            adverse determination and providing supporting documents in
            accordance with the procedures contained in the notification. The
            awardee&apos;s request to NIFA for review must be received within 60
            days after receipt of the written notification of the adverse
            determination; however, an extension may be granted if the awardee
            can show good cause why an extension is warranted.

          For each RFA, NIFA may develop and include the appropriate types of
          projects and focus areas to address the needs of scientists and
          educators in advanced or early stages of their careers and the
          differences in institutional capabilities. Types of projects will be
          revisited periodically based on stakeholder input and as deemed
          appropriate by NIFA. Types of projects under AFRI include, but are not
          limited to, the following.

             research, education, and extension) around a problem or issue. The
            functions addressed in the project should be interwoven throughout
            the life of the project and act to complement and reinforce one
            another. The proposed research component of an Integrated Project
            should address knowledge gaps that are critical to the development
            of practices and programs to address the stated problem. The
            proposed education component of an Integrated Project should
            strengthen institutional capacities and result in curricula and
            related products that will be sustained beyond the life of the
            project. The proposed extension component of an Integrated Project
            should lead to measurable, documented changes in learning, actions,
            or conditions in an identified audience or stakeholder group.
            Appropriate project activities will be discussed in the RFA.

             A CAP is a type of Research, Education, Extension, or Integrated
            Project that supports large-scale multi-million dollar projects that
            promote collaboration, open communication, and the exchange of
            information; reduce duplication of effort; and coordinate activities
            among individuals, institutions, States, and regions. Integrated CAP
            grants address problems through multi-function projects that
            incorporate at least two of the three components of the agricultural
            knowledge system (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.,
            </E>
             research, extension and education). Please note that there
            occasionally may be programs in which an Integrated CAP Grant is
            required to address all three components of the agricultural
            knowledge system. In a CAP, participants serve as a team that
            conducts targeted research, education and/or extension in response
            to emerging or priority area(s) of national need. A CAP contains the
            needed science-based expertise in research, education, and/or
            extension, as well as expertise from principle stakeholders and
            partners, to accomplish project goals and objectives.

             Planning/Coordination Grants provide assistance to applicants in
            the development of quality future CAP applications. Applications
            must articulate benefits accrued from formal planning activities and
            provide evidence of a high likelihood that quality future
            applications will be submitted. These activities can take the form
            of workshops or symposia that bring together biological, physical,
            and social scientists and others as appropriate, including end-users
            and technology providers, to identify research, education, and/or
            extension needs, foster collaboration, and create networking
            opportunities. These events and the information they generate should
            be used to build teams that can develop applications to address
            priorities identified in the RFA.

             The Centers and Subcenter shall jointly develop and submit to NIFA
            for approval a plan for addressing the bioenergy, biomass, and
            gasification research priorities of the Department and the
            Department of Energy at the State and regional levels. To comply
            with this requirement, NIFA requires that the proposals from each of
            the five Centers be of similar format and subject matter and
            complementary to comprise a national program for purposes of serving
            as the actual “plan.” Each proposal will present a plan that
            includes a description of what will be done in common and
            collectively by the Centers and Subcenter, what each will do as a
            Center and Subcenter, and how each Center and Subcenter will
            implement its regional competitive grants program. Proposals
            submitted to the Sun Grant Program must be sufficiently detailed and
            of high enough quality and demonstrate adequate evidence of
            collaboration to meet this requirement. Funds available for
