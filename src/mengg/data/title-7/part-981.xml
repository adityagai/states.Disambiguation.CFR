          by another) or in any other way to put almonds grown in the area of
          production into any channel of trade for human consumption worldwide,
          either within the area of production or by transfer from the area of
          production to points outside or by receipt as first receiver at any
          point of entry in the United States or Puerto Rico of almonds grown in
          the area of production, exported therefrom and submitted for reentry
          or which are reentered free of duty. However, sales or deliveries by a
          grower to handlers, hullers or other processors within the area of
          production shall not, in itself, be considered as handling by a
          grower.

          Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and supporting
          information supplied by the Board or from any other available
          information, that to designate the percentages of almonds during any
          crop year which shall be salable almonds and reserve almonds would
          tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall designate
          such percentages. Except as provided in

           the salable and reserve percentages shall each be applied to the
          kernel weight of almonds received by a handler for his own account
          during the crop year. In establishing such salable and reserve
          percentages, the Secretary shall give consideration to the ratio of
          estimated trade demand (domestic plus export, less the handler
          carryover available to satisfy trade demand plus the desirable handler
          carryover at the end of the crop year) to the estimated production of
          marketable almonds (all expressed in terms of kernel weight) or the
          allocation quantity (marketable production plus almonds diverted to
          oil or feed when eligible for reserve satisfaction) whichever is
          applicable; the recommendation submitted to him by the Board; and such
          other information as he deems appropriate. The total of the salable
          and reserve percentages established each crop year shall equal 100

          year, each handler shall withhold from handling a quantity of almonds

          The Board, on the basis of reports by handlers, shall redetermine the
          kernel weight of almonds received by each handler for his own account
          during each crop year through each of the following dates: December
          31, March 31, and June 30. Such redetermined kernel weight for each
          handler shall be the basis for computing his reserve obligation for
          the crop year through such dates, except that adjustment shall be made
          for almonds on which the obligation has been assumed by another
          handler. The redetermined kernel weight of each handler&apos;s
          receipts, as of any date during the crop year, shall be his carryover
          as of that date plus the weight of almonds delivered or used in
          products minus the carryover at the beginning of the crop year, the
          weight on which another handler has assumed the obligations, and the
          weight delivered to exempt outlets. Weights used in such computations

          Upon request of a handler, made prior to the delivery by him of any

           in disposing of the reserve withheld from handling by such handler
          for that crop year. Any handler who is authorized to dispose of his
          reserve may, through arrangement with another handler dispose of such
          reserve through such other handler or, in lieu of disposition, may
          acquire credits for reserve disposition from another handler. In the

          conditions of

          such reserve to effect disposition thereof in accordance with all
          applicable requirements and conditions. The proceeds of such
          disposition shall be retained by the handler making the disposition,
          except that, in case he disposes of the reserve of another handler,
          the proceeds from that disposition shall be divided between the two
          handlers on the basis of a mutual agreement. Such authorization shall
          expire as of December 31 of the next crop year, and any reserve then
          remaining undisposed of by the handler shall be returned to the Board.

          correspondingly. Any handler who has been authorized to act as agent
          of the Board in disposing of his reserve may terminate such agency as
          of April 1 of the particular crop year by giving written notice to the
          Board to that effect not later than the previous March 20, in which
          event such handler shall return to the Board, for disposition by it,
          all reserve almonds remaining in his possession. In case a handler
          does not terminate his agency as of April 1, he shall be required to
          continue to serve as such agent until December 31 of the next crop
          year. The Board shall not terminate such an agency prior to December
          31 unless the agent violates the terms and conditions specified by the
          Board or other provisions of the order. During the period of such
          agency the Board, as principal, shall not dispose of the reserve

            analysis of a 1,000 gram sample taken from a lot of almonds weighing
            10,000 pounds with less than 95 percent kernels, and a 1,000 gram
            sample taken from a lot of almonds weighing 10,000 pounds with 95
            percent or more kernels. The first computation example is for the
            lot with less than 95 percent kernels containing the following:
            Edible kernels, 530 grams; inedible kernels, 120 grams; foreign
            material, 350 grams, and moisture content of kernels, seven percent.
            Excess moisture is two percent. The second computation example is
            for the lot with 95 percent or more kernels containing the
            following: Edible kernels, 840 grams; inedible kernels, 120 grams;
            foreign material, 40 grams; and moisture content of kernels, seven
            percent. Excess moisture is two percent. The example computations

             Each handler shall cause a representative sample of almonds to be

            is processed or stored by the handler. For receipts at premises with
            mechanical sampling equipment and under contracts providing for
            payment by the handler to the producer for sound meat content,
            samples shall be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the

             Each handler shall meet its disposition obligation by delivering

            meal accumulated in manufacturing, or other material, to crushers,
            feed manufacturers, feeders, or dealers in nut wastes on record with
            the Board as accepted users. Handlers shall notify the Board at
            least 72 hours prior to delivery: 
            <E T='03'>
              Provided,

            whenever it determines that the 72 hour requirement is
            impracticable. The Board may supervise deliveries at its option. In
            the case of a handler having an annual total obligation of less than
            1,000 pounds, delivery may be to the Board in lieu of an accepted
            user, in which case the Board would certify the disposition lot and
            report the results to the USDA. For dispositions by handlers with
            mechanical sampling equipment, samples may be drawn by the handler
            in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency. For
            all other dispositions, samples shall be drawn by or under

            the inspection agency, sampling may be accomplished at the accepted
            user&apos;s destination. The edible and inedible almond meat content
            of each delivery shall be determined by the inspection agency and
            reported by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler. The
            handler&apos;s disposition obligation will be credited upon
            satisfactory completion of ABC Form 8. ABC Form 8, Part A, is filled
            out by the handler, and Part B by the accepted user. Beginning
            August 1, 2006, at least 50 percent of a handler&apos;s total crop
            year inedible disposition obligation shall be satisfied with

            the Board. The reports shall be received by the Board within five
            calendar days after the close of each month of the crop year.
