             State Offices are directed to require title insurance for all loan
            closings unless the agency determines that the use of title
            insurance is not available or is economically not feasible for the
            type of loan involved or the area of the state where the loan will
            be closed. If title insurance is used, State Offices are authorized
            to require a closing protection letter issued by an approved title
            insurance company to cover the closing agent, if available. A
            closing protection letter need not be furnished when the closing is
            conducted by the title insurance company.

             An attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close
            agency real estate loans, provide necessary title clearance, and
            perform such other duties as required in this subpart. A closing
            agent will be responsible for closing agency loans and disbursing
            both agency loan funds and funds provided by the borrower in
            connection with the agency loan so as to obtain title and security
            position as required by the agency. The closing agent must be
            covered by a fidelity bond which will protect the agency unless a
            closing protection letter is provided to the agency. The borrower
            will select the approved closing agent. If title clearance is by an
            attorney&apos;s opinion, the agency will approve the attorney who
            will perform the closing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this
            section. The attorney will be approved after submitting a
            certification acceptable to the agency. If title certification is by
            means of a policy of title insurance, the title company which will
            issue the policy must have been approved in accordance with
            paragraph (d) of this section. A closing agent&apos;s delay in
            providing services without justification in connection with agency
            loans may be a basis for not approving the closing agent in future
            cases.

             Any attorney selected by an applicant, who will be providing title
            clearance where the certificate of title will be an attorney&apos;s
            opinion, must submit an agency form certifying to professional
            liability insurance coverage. If the attorney is also the closing
            agent, fidelity coverage for the attorney and any employee having
            access to the funds must be provided. The agency will determine the
            appropriate level of such insurance. Required insurance will, as a
            minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed. The agency will
            approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. The agency will
            approve any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the
            state where the real estate security is located and who complies
            with the bonding and insurance requirements in this section. If the
            certification of title will be by means of title insurance, any
            attorney or closing agent designated as an approved attorney or
            closing agent by the approved title insurance company which will
            issue the policy of title insurance will be acceptable, and when
            covered by a closing protection letter, will not be required to
            obtain professional liability insurance or a fidelity bond. Each
            approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their
            approved attorneys that are covered by its closing protection
            letters to the State Office and, in such cases the attorneys are
            approved for closings for that title insurance company. Delay in
            providing closing services without justification may be a basis for
            not approving the attorney in future cases.

            be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects
            in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the title, the

            condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions
            to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must
            include a commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least
            equal the amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be
            an outstanding owner&apos;s policy in favor of the borrower. Not

            assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be
            continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance
            and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full
            force and effect.

        <P>
          The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, borrower,
          seller, and other necessary parties to arrange the time and place of
          closing. The transaction may be closed when the agency determines that
          the agency requirements for the loan have been satisfied and the
          closing agent or approved attorney can issue or cause to be issued a
          policy of title insurance or final title opinion as of the date of
          closing showing title vested as required by the agency, the lien of
          the agency&apos;s mortgage in the priority required by the agency, and
          title to the mortgaged property subject only to those exceptions
          approved in writing by the agency. The loan will be considered closed
          when the mortgage is filed for record and the required lien is
          obtained.

             When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to

            closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of
            the mortgage for record; however, when necessary, loan funds may be
            placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and
            disbursed after it is filed. No development funds will be kept in
            escrow by the closing agent after loan closing, unless approved by
            the agency. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed
            only upon the recording of a discharge, satisfaction, or release of
            prior lien interests (or assignment where necessary to protect the
            interests of the agency).

            at closing and will be added to the amount required to be paid by
            borrower at closing. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between
            the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the
            seller which are applicable to a period

             The loan will not be closed if, at the loan closing, the seller (in
            a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a nonpurchase money loan
            situation) indicates that construction, repair, or remodeling has
            been commenced or completed on the property, or related materials or
            services have been delivered to or performed on the property within
            the time limit specified in the affidavit, unless a State Supplement
            provides otherwise. The closing agent will notify the approval
            official, who will determine if the work of improvement could result
            in a lien prior to the agency lien. The State Office will, with the
            advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a State Supplement the
            period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.

            show the book and page of recording of the agency security
            instrument, the words “and is recorded” in the final title opinion
            form provided by the agency office, may be deleted and the blank

            official has furnished to the attorney which were not previously
            returned. The attorney will ensure that all recorded instruments are
            forwarded or delivered to the proper parties after recording. The
            certification of title will be forwarded for a voluntary conveyance.
