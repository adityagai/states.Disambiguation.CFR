          This part contains the terms and conditions for loans made under the
          Special Apple Loan Program. These regulations are applicable to
          applicants, borrowers, and other parties involved in making,
          servicing, and liquidating these loans. The program objective is to
          assist producers of apples suffering from economic loss as a result of
          low apple prices.

            (including debts to the Internal Revenue Service) when the ability
            to repay was within their control will demonstrate unacceptable
            credit history. Unacceptable credit history will not include
            isolated instances of late payments which do not represent a pattern
            and were clearly beyond the applicant&apos;s control or lack of
            credit history.

            applicants will provide all information necessary for the Agency to
