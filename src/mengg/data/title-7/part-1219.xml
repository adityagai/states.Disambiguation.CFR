             A Hass Avocado Board, called the Board elsewhere in this part, is

            subpart, each of whom shall have an alternate nominated and
            appointed in the same manner as members of the Board are nominated
            and appointed. Board members and alternates shall be domiciled in
            the United States.

            reflects the proportion of domestic production and imports supplying
            the United States market. Such proportion shall

             Three years after the assessment of funds commences pursuant to
            this subpart, and at the end of each three-year period thereafter,
            the Board shall review the production of domestic Hass avocados in
            the United States and the volume of imported Hass avocados on the
            basis of the amount of assessments collected from producers and
            importers over the immediately preceding three-year period and, if
            warranted, recommend to the Secretary the reapportionment of the
            positions authorized in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to reflect
            changes in the proportion of domestic Hass avocado production to the
            volume of imported Hass avocados, to the extent possible in the Act.
            Any adjustment under this paragraph shall be subject to the review
            and approval of the Secretary.

             means a person who is involved in, as a substantial activity, the
            importation of Hass avocados for sale or marketing in the United
            States (either directly or as an agent, broker, or consignee of any
            person that produces Hass avocados outside of the United States for
            sale in the United States), who is subject to assessments under the
            Order, and who is listed by Customs as the importer of record for
            such Hass avocados. A substantial activity means that the volume of
            a person&apos;s Hass avocado imports must exceed the volume of the
            person&apos;s production or handling of domestic Hass avocados.

            Secretary finds that the recommendation of the Board shows adequate
            cause, the member shall be removed from office.

             Should any alternate member become vacant in the event of death,
            removal, resignation, or disqualification, the Board may nominate
            persons to serve for the unexpired term of such alternate member.
            The nomination shall be conducted at a regularly scheduled Board
            meeting as soon as practicable after the vacancy occurs. The Board
            may solicit the names of nominees from producers and importers prior
            to the meeting and from the floor of the meeting. All nominees must
            meet the qualifications for nomination. The Board shall submit two
            nominees for each vacancy to the Secretary. A vacancy will not be
            required to be filled if the unexpired term is less than six months.

             At a properly convened meeting of the Board, seven (7) members,
            including alternates acting in place of members of the Board, shall
            constitute a quorum:

             that such alternates shall serve only when the member is absent
            from a meeting. Any action of the Board shall require the concurring
            votes of a majority of those present and voting. At assembled
            meetings, all votes shall be cast in person.

             In lieu of voting at a properly convened meeting and, when in the
            opinion of the chairperson of the Board such action is considered
            necessary, the Board may take action if supported by one vote more
            than 50 percent of the members by mail, telephone, electronic mail,
            facsimile, or other means of communication. Such alternative means
            for the Board taking action may be undertaken for various reasons.
            These reasons include the need to address matters of an emergency
            nature when there is not enough time to call an assembled meeting of
            the Board. All telephone votes shall be confirmed promptly in
            writing. In that event, all members must be notified and provided an
            opportunity to vote. Any action so taken shall have the same force
            and effect as though such action had been taken at a properly
            convened meeting of the Board. All votes shall be recorded in the
            Board minutes.
