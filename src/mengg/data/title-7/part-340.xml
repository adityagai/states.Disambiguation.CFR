            If the application is complete, the responsible individual shall be

            the interstate movement of multiple regulated articles in lieu of
            submitting an application for each individual interstate movement.
            Each limited permit issued shall be numbered and shall be valid for

            multiple interstate movements between contained facilities the

            the regulated articles to be moved interstate; the origins and

            locations specified in the application. If a person seeks to move

            permit. APHIS will confirm the reasons for the withdrawal of the
            permit in writing within ten (10) days. Any person whose permit has
            been withdrawn or any person who has been denied a permit may appeal
            the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days
            after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal or
            denial. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon
            which the person relies to show that the permit was wrongfully
            withdrawn or denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny the
            appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly
            as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material
            fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of
            practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the
            Administrator.
