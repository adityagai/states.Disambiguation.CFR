          Because the State agencies of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
          provide free meals or milk to all children in schools under their

          determinations or publicly announce eligibility criteria. Instead,

            eligibility criteria for free and reduced price meals or for free
            milk. In such a situation, the local educational agency shall
            complete and file an application for such child setting forth the
            basis of determining the child&apos;s eligibility. When a local
            educational agency has obtained a determination of individual family
            income and family-size data from other sources, it need not require
            the submission of an application for any child from a family whose
            income would qualify for free or reduced price meals or for free
            milk under the local educational agency&apos;s established criteria.
            In such event, the School Food Authority shall notify the family
            that its children are eligible for free or reduced price meals or
            for free milk. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to provide
            authority for the local educational agency to make eligibility
            determinations or certifications by categories or groups of
            children.

             Collateral contacts are verbal confirmations of a household&apos;s
            circumstances by a person outside of the household. The collateral
            contact may be made in person or by phone. The verifying official
            may select a collateral contact if the household fails to designate
            one or designates one which is unacceptable to the verifying
            official. If the verifying official designates a collateral contact,
            the contact shall not be made without providing written or oral
            notice to the household. At the time of this notice, the household
            shall be informed that it may consent to the contact or provide
            acceptable documentation in another form. If the household refuses
            to choose one of these options, its eligibility shall be terminated
            in accordance with the normal procedures for failure to cooperate
            with verification efforts. Collateral contacts could include
            employers, social service agencies, and migrant agencies.

            members in carrying out efforts to verify the correctness of
            information stated on the application and continued eligibility for
            the program. These verification efforts may be carried out through

            contacting offices administering means-tested programs or the State
            employment security office and checking documentation produced by
            household members to prove the amount of income received. These

            paid) during the base year must be converted to monthly percentages
            for each meal type. For example, the free lunch percentage is

            of all reimbursable lunches served in the second, third and fourth

             At the end of the initial cycle, and each subsequent 4-year cycle,
            the State agency may allow a school to continue under Provision 3
            for another 4 years without taking new free and reduced price
            applications and meal counts by type. 
            <PRTPAGE P='345' />
            State agencies may grant an extension of Provision 3 if the school
            food authority can establish, through available and approved
            socioeconomic data, that the income level of the school&apos;s
            population, as adjusted for inflation, has remained stable,
            declined, or has had only negligible improvement since the most
            recent base year.

             Pre-approved sources of socioeconomic data which may be used by
            school food authorities to establish the income level of the
            school&apos;s population are: local data collected by the city or
            county zoning and economic planning office; unemployment data; local
            SNAP certification data including direct certification; Food
            Distribution Program on Indian Reservations data; statistical
            sampling of the school&apos;s population using the application
            process; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families data (provided
            that the eligibility standards were the same or more restrictive in
            the base year as the current year with allowance for inflation). To
            grant an extension using pre-approved socioeconomic data sources,
            State agencies must review and evaluate the socioeconomic data
            submitted by the school food authority to ensure that it is
            reflective of the school&apos;s population, provides equivalent data
            for both the base year and the last year of the current cycle, and
            demonstrates that the income level of the school&apos;s population,
            as adjusted for inflation, has remained stable, declined or had only
            negligible improvement. If the school food authority wants to
            establish the income level of the school&apos;s population using
            alternate sources of data, the use of such data must be approved by
            the Food and Nutrition Service. Data from alternate sources must be
            reflective of the school&apos;s population, be equivalent data for
            both the base year and the last year of the current cycle, and
            effectively measure whether the income level of the school&apos;s
            population, as adjusted for inflation, has remained stable, declined
            or had only negligible improvement.

             School food authorities that are granted an extension of a
            provision must retain records of the available and approved
            socioeconomic data which is used to determine the income level of
            the school&apos;s population for the base year and year(s) in which
            extension(s) are made. In addition, State agencies must also retain
            records of the available and approved socioeconomic data which is
            used to determine the income level of the school&apos;s population
            for the base year and year(s) in which extensions are made. Such
            records must be retained at both the school food authority level and
            at the State agency during the period the provision is in effect,
            including all extensions, plus 3 fiscal years after the submission
            of the last monthly Claim for Reimbursement which employed base year
            data. If audit findings have not been resolved, records must be
            retained beyond the 3-year period as long as required for the
            resolution of the issues raised by the audit. In addition, for
            schools operating under Provision 2, a school food authority must
            retain non-base year records pertaining to total daily meal count
            information, edit checks and on-site review documentation. For
            schools operating under Provision 3, a school food authority must
            retain non-base year records pertaining to total daily meal count
            information, the system of oversight or edit checks, on-site review
            documentation, annual enrollment data and the number of operating
            days, which are used to adjust the level of assistance. Such records
            shall be retained for three years after submission of the final
            monthly Claim for Reimbursement for the fiscal year.

             When revision of a local educational agency&apos;s approved free

            change in the family-size income standards of the State agency, or
            FNSRO where applicable, or because of other program changes, the
            local educational agency shall have 60 days from the date the State
            agency announces the change in which to have its revised policy
            statement approved by the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable.
            In the event that a local educational agency&apos;s proposed revised
            free and reduced price policy statement has not been submitted to,
            and approved by, the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, within
            60 days following the public announcement by the State agency,
            reimbursement shall be suspended for any meals or milk served after
            the end of the 60-day period. No commodities donated by the
            Department shall be used in any school after the end of the 60-day
            period, until such time as the local educational agency&apos;s free
            and reduced price policy statement has been approved by the State
            agency, or FNSRO where applicable. Reimbursement may be allowed at
            the discretion of the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, for
            eligible meals and milk served during the period of suspension once
            the local educational agency&apos;s free and reduced price policy
            statement has been approved by the State agency, or FNSRO where
            applicable. Pending approval of a revision of a policy statement,
            the existing statement shall remain in effect.

             No later than March 1, 2005 and by March 1st each year thereafter,
            each State agency must collect annual verification data from each
            local educational agency as described in

             and in accordance with guidelines provided by FNS. Each State
            agency must analyze these data, determine if there are potential
            problems, and formulate corrective actions and technical assistance
            activities that will support the objective of certifying only those
            children eligible for free or reduced price meals. No later than
            April 15, 2005 and by April 15 each year thereafter, each State
            agency must report to FNS the verification information in a
            consolidated electronic file that has been reported to it as

            , by local educational agency, and any ameliorative actions the
            State agency has taken or intends to take in local educational
            agencyies with high levels of applications changed due to
            verification. Contingent upon new funding to support this purpose,
            FNS will also require each State agency to report the aggregate
            number of students who were terminated as a result of verification
            but who were reinstated as of February 15th. The first report
            containing this data element would be required in the school year
            beginning July 1, 2005 and each school year thereafter. State
            agencies are encouraged to collect and report any or all
            verification data elements before the required dates.
