          and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the procedures by
          which the public may obtain such information, shall be governed by the
          Department regulations as implemented by the regulations in this part.
          It is the policy of APHIS to be an open agency and to promptly make
          available for public inspection any records or information which are
          required to be released under the Act. Material which is exempt from
          disclosure will also be promptly made available when the Agency in its
          discretion determines that release of such material is in the public
          interest.
