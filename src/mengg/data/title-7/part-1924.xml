            statutory requirements will be used as the forms of payment bond and
            performance bond to be provided. Unless noncorporate surety is
            provided, the surety bonds may only be obtained from a corporate
            bonding company listed on the current Department of the Treasury
            Circular 570 (published annually in the

            Federal bonds and as legally doing business in the State where the
            land is located. Noncorporate sureties are not recommended and the
            State Director will be responsible for determining the acceptability
            of the individual or individuals proposed as sureties on the bonds.
            The State Director must determine that an individual or individuals
            proposed as sureties must have cash or other liquid assets easily
            convertible to cash in an amount at least equal to 25 percent more
            than the contract amount in order to be acceptable. The
            individual(s) will pledge such liquid assets in an amount equal to
            the contract amount. Fees charged for noncorporate sureties may not
            exceed fees charged by corporate sureties on bonds of equal amount
            and, in no case, may surety be provided by the applicant or any
            person or organization with an identity of interest in the
            applicant&apos;s operation. The United States (including FmHA or its

             The County Supervisor or District Director, accompanied by the
            borrower when practicable, will make final inspection of all
            development work and periodic inspections as appropriate to protect
            the security interest of the government. In this respect,
            inspections other than final inspections, may be conducted by other
            qualified persons as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, in

             The County Supervisor or District Director will inspect development
            work as frequently as necessary to assure that construction and land
            development conforms to the drawings and specifications. The final
            inspection will be made at the earliest possible date after
            completion of the planned development. When several major items of
            development are involved, final inspection will be made upon
            completion of each item.

             Customarily, the initial inspection in construction cases is made
            just prior to or during the placement of concrete footings or
            monolithic footings and floor slabs. At this point, foundation
            excavations are complete, forms or trenches and steel are ready for
            concrete placement and the subsurface installation is roughed in.
            However, when it is not practicable to make the initial inspection
            prior to or during the placement of concrete, the County Supervisor
            or District Director will make the initial inspection as soon as
            possible after the placement of concrete and before any backfill is
            in place.

             Planning is an evaluation of specific development for a specific
            site. Planning must take into consideration topography, soils,
            climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy
            efficiency, local economy, aesthetic and cultural values, public and
            private services, housing and social conditions, and a degree of
            flexibility to accommodate changing demands. All planning and
            performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant
            or developer. All development will be arranged and completed
            according to applicable local, state, or Federal regulations
            including applicable health and safety standards, environmental
            requirements, and requirements of this subpart. When a public
            authority requires inspections prior to final acceptance, written
            assurance by the responsible public authority of compliance with
            local, city, county, state or other public codes, regulations, and
            ordinances is required prior to final acceptance by RHS.

            used as planned and that other purchasers will use and maintain the
            land as planned to prevent changes in the character of the

           must determine whether defects are structural or non-structural. If
          the defect is structural and is covered by the
          builder&apos;s/dealer-contractor&apos;s (the “contractor”) warranty,
          the contractor is expected to correct the defect. If the contractor
          cannot or will not correct the defect, the costs of correcting the
          defect may be paid by the Government, or the borrower may be
          compensated for correcting the defect, under the provisions of this
          subpart. If the defect is non-structural but is covered under the
          provisions of the contractor&apos;s warranty or independent home
          warranty, the contractor is still expected to correct the defect. FmHA

           will assist the borrower in obtaining assistance through the
          independent home warranty company&apos;s and/or manufacturer&apos;s
          complaint resolution process. However, if the contractor cannot or
          will not correct a non-structural defect covered under the provisions
          of the contractor&apos;s warranty, the Government will not pay the
          costs for correcting the defect, nor will the borrower be compensated
          for doing so.

          both the contractor&apos;s company name and the principal parties as
          individuals, and any successor entities, if known. If the manufacturer
          of the defective product is determined to be solely responsible, no
          action will be taken against the contractor. In such a case, debarment
          will be initiated against the manufacturer. An assignment of the
          borrower&apos;s claim against the contractor or other party will be
          obtained if it appears to the approval officials, with any necessary
          advice from the Office of the General Counsel, that recovery is
          reasonably possible.
