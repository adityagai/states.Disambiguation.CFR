          The Department of Agriculture is designated as the lead Federal agency
          for higher education in the food and agricultural sciences. In this
          context, NIFA has specific responsibility to initiate and support
          projects to strengthen college and university teaching programs in the
          food and agricultural sciences. One national initiative for

          carrying out this responsibility is the competitive Higher Education
          Challenge Grants Program. A primary goal of the program is to attract
          and ensure a continual flow of outstanding students into food and
          agricultural sciences higher education programs and to provide them
          with an education of the highest quality available anywhere in the
          world and which reflects the unique needs of the Nation. It is
          designed to stimulate and enable colleges and universities to provide
          the quality of education necessary to produce baccalaureate or higher
          degree level graduates capable of strengthening the Nation&apos;s food
          and agricultural scientific and professional work force. It is

             The purpose of this initiative is to advance faculty development in
            the areas of teaching competency, subject matter expertise, or
            student recruitment and advising skills. Teachers are central to
            education. They serve as models, motivators, and mentors—the
            catalysts of the learning process. Moreover, teachers are agents for
            developing, replicating, and exchanging effective teaching materials
            and methods. For these reasons, education can be strengthened only
            when teachers are adequately prepared, highly motivated, and
            appropriately recognized and rewarded.

             The purpose of this initiative is to encourage the use of
            alternative methods of delivering instruction to enhance the
            quality, effectiveness, and cost efficiency of teaching programs.
            The importance of this initiative is evidenced by advances in
            educational research which have substantiated the theory that
            differences in the learning styles of students often require
            alternative instructional methodologies. Also, the rising costs of
            higher education strongly suggest that colleges and universities
            undertake more efforts of a collaborative nature in order to deliver
            instruction which maximizes program quality and reduces unnecessary
            duplication. At the same time, advancements in knowledge and
            technology continue to introduce new subject matter areas which
            warrant consideration and implementation of innovative instruction
            techniques, methodologies, and delivery systems.

            university faculty, and other professionals in the food and
            agricultural sciences. A substantial need exists to supplement
            efforts to attract increased numbers of academically outstanding
            students to prepare for careers as food and agricultural scientists
            and professionals. It is particularly important to augment the
            racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the student body in order to
            promote a robust exchange of ideas and a more effective use of the
            full breadth of the Nation&apos;s intellectual resources.

          set forth in OMB Circular No. A-21, some grant funds may be used for
          minor alterations, renovations, or repairs deemed necessary to
          retrofit existing teaching spaces in order to carry out a funded
          project. However, requests to use grant funds for such purposes must
          demonstrate that the alterations, renovations, or repairs are
          incidental to the major purpose for which a grant is made.

            detailed table of contents just after the Proposal Cover Page. The
            Table of Contents should include page numbers for each component of
            the 
            <PRTPAGE P='400' />
            proposal. Pagination should begin immediately following the Table of
            Contents.

             The Project Summary should be a concise description of the proposed
            activity suitable for publication by the Department to inform the
            general public about awards under the program. The text must not
            exceed one page, single-spaced. The Project Summary should be a
            self-contained description of the activity which would result if the
            proposal is funded by USDA. It should include: The objectives of the
            project; a synopsis of the plan of operation; a description of how
            the project will strengthen higher education in the food and
            agricultural sciences in the United States; and the plans for
            disseminating project results. The Project Summary should be written
            so that a technically literate reader can evaluate the use of
            Federal funds in support of the project.

            such should be indicated in block 13. on Form NIFA-712, “Higher

            be included in the proposal: The fiscal year(s) in which the
            proposal was submitted previously; a summary of the peer
            reviewers&apos; comments; and how these comments have been addressed
            in the current proposal, including the page numbers in the current
            proposal where the peer reviewers&apos; comments have been
            addressed. This information may be provided as a section of the
            proposal following the Project Summary and preceding the proposal

            choose to resubmit proposals that were previously submitted, but not
            funded, should note that resubmitted proposals must compete equally
            with newly submitted proposals. Submitting a proposal that has been
            revised based on a previous peer review panel&apos;s critique of the
            proposal does not guarantee the success of the resubmitted proposal.

             The Higher Education Challenge Grants Program is not designed to
            support activities that essentially are repetitive in nature over
            multiple grant awards. Project directors who have had their projects
            funded previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively
            identical proposals for further funding. Proposals that are
            sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded
            Challenge Grants Program projects must compete with first-time
            proposals. Therefore, project directors should thoroughly
            demonstrate how the project proposed in the current application
            expands substantially upon a previously funded project (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.
            </E>
            , demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to
            the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The
            proposal must also show the degree to which the 
            <PRTPAGE P='401' />
            new phase promotes innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of
            the previously funded project.

             Each project narrative is expected to be complete in itself and to

            should not be used to circumvent the 20-page limitation of the
            proposal narrative. However, in those instances where inclusion of
            supplemental information is necessary to guarantee the peer review
            panel&apos;s complete understanding of a proposal or to illustrate
            the integrity of the design or a main thesis of the proposal, such
            information may be included in an Appendix. Examples of supplemental
            material are photographs, journal reprints, brochures and other
            pertinent materials which are deemed to be illustrative of major
            points in the narrative but unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal
            narrative itself. Information on previously submitted proposals may
            also be presented in the Appendix (refer to

            tabular format. A complete set of the Appendix material must be
            attached to each copy of the grant application submitted. The
            Appendix must be identified with the title of the project as it
            appears on Form NIFA-712 of the proposal and the name(s) of the
            project director(s). The Appendix must be referenced in the proposal

          To assist NIFA in preparing for the review of proposals, institutions
          planning to submit proposals may be requested to complete Form
          NIFA-711, “Intent to Submit a Proposal,” provided in the application
          package. NIFA will determine each year if Intent to Submit a Proposal
          forms will be requested and provide such information in the program
          announcement. If Intent to Submit a Proposal forms are required, one
          form should be completed and returned for each proposal an institution
          anticipates submitting. Submitting this form does not commit an
          institution to any course of action, nor does failure to send this
          form prohibit an institution from submitting a proposal.

          Confidential aspects of proposals and awards.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          When a proposal results in a grant, it becomes a part of the record of
          the Agency&apos;s transactions, available to the public upon specific
          request. Information that the Secretary determines to be of a
          privileged nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted
          by law. Therefore, any information that the applicant wishes to have
          considered as privileged should be clearly marked as such and sent in
          a separate statement, two copies of which should accompany the
          proposal. The original copy of a proposal that does not result in a
          grant will be retained by the Agency for a period of one year. Other
          copies will be destroyed. Such a proposal will be released only with
          the consent of the applicant or to the extent required by law. A
          proposal may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final action
          thereon.

          Grantees should be aware that NIFA may, as a part of its own program
          evaluation activities, carry out in-depth evaluations of assisted
          activities. Thus, grantees should be prepared to cooperate with NIFA
          personnel, or persons retained by NIFA, evaluating the institutional
          context and the impact of any supported project. Grantees may be asked
          to provide general information on any students and faculty supported,
          in whole or in part, by a grant awarded under this program;
          information that may be requested includes, but is not limited to,
          standardized academic achievement test scores, grade point average,
          academic standing, career patterns, age, race/ethnicity, gender,
          citizenship, and disability.
