          For Walla Walla Sweet Onions handled prior to September 1, the
          Committee shall impose an interest charge on any handler who fails to
          pay his or her annual assessments within thirty (30) days of the due
          date of September 30. For Walla Walla Sweet Onions handled during the
          period September 1 through May 31, the Committee shall impose an
          interest charge on any handler who fails to pay his or her assessments
          within thirty (30) days of the last day of the month in which such
          shipments are made. The interest charge shall be 1
          <FR>
            1/2
          </FR>
           percent of the unpaid assessment balance. In the event the handler
          fails to pay the delinquent assessment amount within 60 days following
          the due date, the 1
          <FR>
            1/2
          </FR>
           percent interest charge shall be applied monthly thereafter to the
          unpaid balance, including any accumulated interest. Any amount paid by
          a handler as an assessment, including any charges imposed pursuant to
          this paragraph, shall be credited when the payment is received in the
          Committee office.
