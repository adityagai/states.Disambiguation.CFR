          The Honey Packers and Importers Board is established to administer the

          representatives, one importer-handler representative, three producer
          representatives, and one marketing cooperative representative. The

          honey or honey products they market in the United States and handle at
          least 250,000 pounds annually. In addition, the producer
          representatives must produce a minimum of 150,000 pounds of honey in
          the United States annually based on the best three-year average of the
          most recent five calendar years, as certified by producers. The
          Secretary will appoint members to the Board from nominees submitted in
          accordance with

          Term of office.

        <P>
          With the exception of the initial Board, each Board member and
          alternate will serve a three-year term or until the Secretary selects
          his or her successor. No member or alternate may serve more than two
          consecutive terms, excluding any initial two-year term of office. The
          terms of the initial Board members shall be staggered for two-,
          three-, and four-year terms. For the initial Board, one producer, one
          first handler, one importer, and the representative of a national
          honey cooperative will serve a two-year term of office. One producer,
          one first handler, and the importer-handler representative, will serve
          a three-year term of office. One producer, one first handler, and one
          importer will serve a four-year term of office. Determination of which
          of the initial members and their alternates shall serve two-year,
          three-year or four-year terms, shall be designated by the Secretary.
          Thereafter, each of these positions will carry a full three-year term.
          Members serving initial terms of two or four years will be eligible to
          serve a second term of three years. Each term of office will end on
          December 31, with new terms of office beginning on January 1. If this
          part becomes effective on a date such that the initial period is less
          than six months in duration, then the tolling of time for purposes of
          this subsection shall not begin until the beginning of the first
          12-month fiscal period.
