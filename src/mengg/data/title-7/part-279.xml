             Upon receipt of a request for review of administrative action, the
            administrative action shall be held in abeyance until the designated
            reviewer has made a determination. However, permanent
            disqualifications for trafficking shall not be held in abeyance and
            shall be effective immediately as specified in 278.6(b)(2) of this
            chapter. If the disqualification is reversed through administrative
            or judicial review, the Secretary shall not be held liable for the
            value of any sales lost during the disqualification period. If the
            administrative action in question involves the denial of a claim
            brought by a firm against FNS, or the forfeiture of a collateral
            bond or the draw down on an irrevocable letter of credit, the
            designated reviewer shall direct the firm not be approved for
            participation, not be paid any part of the disputed claim, or not be
            reimbursed for any bond forfeiture or irrevocable letter of credit
            withdrawal, as appropriate until the designated reviewer has made a
            determination.
