             Canvassing of form LS-86 shall take place at the county FSA offices
            on the 6th business day following the final day of the voting
            period. Such canvassing, acting on behalf of the Administrator, AMS,
            shall be in the presence of at least two members of the county
            committee. If two or more of the counties have been combined and are
            served by one county office, the canvassing of the requests shall be
            conducted by at least one member of the county committee from each
            county served by the county office. The FSA State committee or the
            State Executive Director, if authorized by the State Committee, may
            designate the County Executive Director (CED) and a county or State
            FSA office employee to canvass the ballots and report the results
            instead of two members of the county committee when it is determined
            that the number of eligible voters is so limited that having two
            members of the county committee present for this function is

            FSA office employee to canvass requests in any emergency situation
            precluding at least two members of the county committee from being
