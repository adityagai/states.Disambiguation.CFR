            authority to theDirector of the National Institute of Food and
            Agriculture (NIFA), to make competitive grants to land-grant
            colleges and universities, to colleges and universities having
            significant minority enrollments and a demonstrable capacity to
            carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences, and to
            other colleges and universities having a demonstrable capacity to
            carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences, for a
            period not to exceed 5 years, to design and implement food and
            agricultural programs to build teaching and research capacity at
            colleges and universities having significant minority enrollments.
            Based on and subject to the express provisions of the annual

            force in the food and agricultural sciences is a proper concern for

            Through its role as administrator of the Second Morrill Act, the

             This program is designed specifically to build the institutional
            teaching and research capacities of the 1890 land-grant institutions
            through cooperative programs with Federal and non-Federal entities.
            The program is competitive among the 1890 Institutions and
            encourages matching funds on the part of the States, private
            organizations, and other non-Federal entities to encourage expanded
            linkages with 1890 Institutions as performers of research and
            education, and as developers of scientific and professional talent
            for the United States food and agricultural system. In addition,
            through this program, NIFA will strive to increase the overall pool
            of qualified job applicants from underrepresented groups in order to
            make significant progress toward achieving the objectives of work
            force diversity within the Federal Government, particularly the U.S.
            Department of Agriculture.

          and research capabilities of applicant institutions. Each 1890
          Institution may submit one or more grant applications for either
          category of grants (as allowed by the annual program notice). However,
          each application must be limited to either a teaching project grant

             The purpose of this need area is to advance faculty development in
            the areas of teaching competency, subject matter expertise, or
            student recruitment and advising skills. Teachers are central to
            education. They serve as models, motivators, and mentors—the
            catalysts of the learning process. Moreover, teachers are agents for
            developing, replicating, and exchanging effective teaching materials
            and methods. For these reasons, education can be strengthened only
            when teachers are adequately prepared, highly motivated, and
            appropriately recognized and rewarded.

             The purpose of this need area is to encourage the use of
            alternative methods of delivering instruction to enhance the
            quality, effectiveness, and cost efficiency of teaching programs.
            The importance of this initiative is evidenced by advances in
            educational research which have substantiated the theory that
            differences in the learning styles of students often require
            alternative instructional methodologies. Also, the 
            <PRTPAGE P='416' />
            rising costs of higher education strongly suggest that colleges and
            universities undertake more efforts of a collaborative nature in
            order to deliver instruction which maximizes program quality and
            reduces unnecessary duplication. At the same time, advancements in
            knowledge and technology continue to introduce new subject matter
            areas which warrant consideration and implementation of innovative
            instruction techniques, methodologies, and delivery systems.

             The purpose of this need area is to further the development of
            student scientific and professional competencies through
            experiential learning programs which provide students with
            opportunities to solve complex problems in the context of real-world
            situations. Effective experiential learning is essential in
            preparing future graduates to advance knowledge and technology,
            enhance quality of life, conserve resources, and revitalize the
            Nation&apos;s economic competitiveness. Such experiential learning
            opportunities are most effective when they serve to advance
            decision-making and communication skills as well as technological
            expertise.

            students to prepare for careers as food and agricultural scientists
            and professionals. It is particularly important to augment the

             Recognizing that capacity building is a long-term ongoing process,
            the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is interested
            in funding subsequent phases of previously funded projects in order
            to build institutional capacity, and institutions are encouraged to
            build on a theme over several grant awards. However, proposals that
            are sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded
            Capacity Building Grants must compete with first-time proposals.
            Therefore, project directors should thoroughly demonstrate how the
            project proposed in the current application expands substantially
            upon a previously funded project (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.
            </E>
            , demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to
            the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The
            proposal must also show the degree to which the new phase promotes
            innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of the previously
            funded project. Please note that the 1890 Institution Capacity
            Building Grants Program is not designed to support activities that
            are essentially repetitive in nature over multiple grant awards.
            Project directors who have had their projects funded previously are
            discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical proposals for
            further funding.

             Each project narrative is expected to be complete in itself and to
            meet the 20-page limitation. Inclusion of material in an Appendix
            should not be used to circumvent the 20-page limitation of the
            proposal narrative. However, in those instances where inclusion of
            supplemental information is necessary to guarantee the peer review
            panel&apos;s complete understanding of a proposal or to illustrate
            the integrity of the design or a main thesis of the proposal, such
            information may be included in an Appendix. Examples of supplemental
            material are photographs, journal reprints, brochures and other
            pertinent materials which are deemed to be illustrative of major
            points in the narrative but unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal
            narrative itself. Information on previously submitted proposals may
            also be presented in the Appendix (refer to paragraph (e) of this
            section). When possible, information in the Appendix should be
            presented in tabular format. A complete set of the Appendix material
            must be attached to each copy of the grant application submitted.
            The Appendix must be identified with the title of the project as it
            appears on Form NIFA-712 of the proposal and the name(s) of the
            project director(s). The Appendix must be referenced in the proposal
            narrative.

          The research component of the program will support projects that
          address high-priority research initiatives in areas such as those
          illustrated in this section where there is a present or anticipated
          need for increased knowledge or capabilities or in which it is
          feasible for applicants to develop programs recognized for their
          excellence. Applicants are also encouraged to include in their
          proposals a library enhancement component related to the initiative(s)
          for which they have prepared their proposals.

            Federal funds in support of the project.

            narrative. Further, when possible, the information should be
            presented in a tabular format. Applicants who choose to resubmit
            proposals that were previously submitted, but not funded, should
            note that resubmitted proposals must compete equally with newly
            submitted proposals. Submitting a proposal that has been revised
            based on a previous peer review panel&apos;s critique of the
            proposal does not guarantee the success of the resubmitted proposal.

             Recognizing that capacity building is a long-term ongoing process,
            the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is interested
            in funding subsequent phases of previously funded projects in order
            to build institutional capacity, and institutions are encouraged to
            build on a theme over several grant awards. However, proposals that
            are sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded
            Capacity Building Grants must compete with first-time proposals.
            Therefore, principal investigators should thoroughly demonstrate how
            the project proposed in the current application expands
            substantially upon a previously funded project (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.
            </E>
            , demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to
            the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The
            proposal must also show the degree to which the new phase promotes
            innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of the previously
            funded project. Please note that the 1890 Institution Capacity
            Building Grants Program is not designed to support activities that
            are essentially repetitive in nature over multiple grant awards.
            Principal investigators who have had their projects funded
            previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical
            proposals for future funding.

            For example, describe how the proposed project is intended to
            strengthen the institution&apos;s research infrastructure by
            advancing the expertise of the current faculty in the natural or
            social sciences; providing a better research environment,
            state-of-the-art equipment, or supplies; enhancing library
            collections; or enabling the institution to provide efficacious
            organizational structures and reward systems to attract and retain
            first-rate research faculty and students—particularly those from
            underrepresented groups.

          When a proposal results in a grant, it becomes a part of the record of
          the Agency&apos;s transactions, available to the public upon specific
          request. Information that the Secretary determines to be of a
          privileged nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted
          by law. Therefore, any information that the applicant wishes to have
          considered as privileged should be clearly marked as such and sent in
          a separate statement, two copies of which should accompany the
          proposal. The original copy of a proposal that does not result in a
          grant will be retained by the Agency for a period of one year. Other
          copies will be destroyed. Such a proposal will be released only with
          the consent of the applicant or to the extent required by law. A
          proposal may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final action
          thereon.

          Grantees should be aware that NIFA may, as a part of its own program
          evaluation activities, carry out in-depth evaluations of assisted
          activities. Thus, grantees should be prepared to cooperate with NIFA
          personnel, or persons retained by NIFA, evaluating the institutional
          context and the impact of any supported project. Grantees may be asked
          to provide general information on any students and faculty supported,
          in whole or in part, by a grant awarded under this program;
          information that may be requested includes, but is not limited to,
          standardized academic achievement test scores, grade point average,
          academic standing, career patterns, age, race/ethnicity, gender,
          citizenship, and disability.
