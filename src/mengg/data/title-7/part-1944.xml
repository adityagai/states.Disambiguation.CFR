            section 509 of

          ). Grants reimburse eligible organizations for part or all of the
          costs of conducting, administering, and coordinating an effective
          housing application packaging program in colonias and designated
          counties. Eligible organizations will aid very low- and low-income
          individuals and families in obtaining benefits from Federal, State,
          and local housing programs. The targeted groups are very low- and
          low-income families without adequate housing who will receive priority
          for recruitment and participation and nonprofit organizations able to
          propose rental or housing rehabilitation assistance benefitting such
          families. These funds are available only in the areas defined in
          exhibit D of this subpart. Participants will assist very low- and
          low-income families in solving their housing needs. One way of
          assisting is to package single family housing applications for
          families wishing to buy, build, or repair houses for their own use.
          Another way is to package applications for organizations wishing to
          develop rental units for lower income families. The intent is to make
          Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under 
          <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

           will reimburse eligible organizations packaging loan/grant
          applications without discrimination because of race, color, religion,
          sex, national origin, age, familial status, or handicap if such an
          organization has authority to contract.

          requirement or provision of this subpart which is not inconsistent
          with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if the

          Deputy Administrator, Single Family Housing. Requests for exceptions
          must be in writing by the State Director and supported with

          interest and/or impact on the applicant, borrower, or community,
          proposed alternative courses of action, and show how the adverse
          effect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted.

            attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a

            plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would
            meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL,

            the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time,

             Equivalent units represent the “theoretical number of units”
            arrived at by adding the equivalent percentage of completion figure
            for each family in the self-help program (pre-construction and
            actual construction) together at any given date during program
            operations. The sum of the percentage of completion figures for all
            participant families represent the total number of “theoretical
            units” completed at any point in time. Equivalent units are useful
            in measuring progress during the period of the grant and are not a
            measurement of actual accomplishments. The number of equivalent
            units for any group can never exceed the number of planned or
            completed houses for that group.

            grantee. This will include a discussion of the number of 502 and 504
            units that will need to be committed to the grantee and the
            potential work impact on the office during the grant period. If it
            is determined that the County Office lacks the resources (either
            personnel or funds) to process all loan requests in a timely manner,
            the District Director must communicate this need to the State
            Director along with a recommended solution. (Lack of resources at
            the county level are not grounds to deny a request). After the
            District Director has determined that the preapplication is complete
            and accurate, the District Director will assemble the material in an
            applicant case

            file and forward it to the State Director. The case file, as a

             The evaluation is a narrative addressed to the State Director with
            a copy of the National Office, Single Family Housing Processing

             After the State Director has reviewed the evaluation, a copy will
            be mailed to the grantee. The grantee may request a review of the
            evaluation with the District Director. This review is for
            clarification of the material and to dispute the findings if they
            are known to be wrong. The rating is not open for discussion except
            to the extent it can be proven that the findings do not support the
            rating. If this is the case, the District Director will file an
            amendment to the State Director.

          The objectives of the TSA Grant Program are to assist low-income rural
          families in obtaining adequate housing to meet their family&apos;s
          needs and/or to provide the necessary guidance to promote their
          continued occupancy of already adequate housing. These objectives will
          be accomplished through the establishment or support of housing
          delivery and counseling projects run by eligible applicants. This
          program is intended to make use of any available housing program which
          provides the low-income rural resident access to adquate rental
          properties or homeownership.

            design and administration. The forms or types of assistance must

            persons residing in individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops
            needing repair and rehabilitation or replacement of individual
            housing.

          The objective of the HPG program is to repair or rehabilitate
          individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops owned and/or occupied
          by very low- and low-income rural persons. Grantees 
          <PRTPAGE P='278' />
          will provide eligible homeowners, owners of rental properties, and
          owners of co-ops with financial assistance through loans, grants,
          interest reduction payments or other comparable financial assistance
          for necessary repairs and rehabilitation. Further, individual housing
          that is owner occupied may qualify for replacement housing when it is
          determined by the grantee that the housing is not economically
          feasible for repair or rehabilitation, except as specified in

             For purposes of this subpart, exhibit A of FmHA Instruction 1940-M
            (available in any Agency office) requires all Rural Development
            applicants; for an HPG to sign and submit with their preapplication,
            Form AD-1047, “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and
            Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions,” which
            basically states that the applicant has not been debarred or
            suspended from Government assistance. Further, all grantees after
            receiving a HPG must obtain a signed certification (Form AD-1048,
            “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
            Voluntary Exclusion—Lower Tier Covered Transactions”) from all
            persons or entities (excluding homeowner recipients) that the
            grantee does business with as a result of the HPG. Grantees are
            responsible for informing these persons or entities of the
            provisions of exhibit A of FmHA Instruction 1940-M (available in any
            Agency office) and of maintaining Form AD-1048 in the grantee&apos;s

          Grantees are responsible for supervising all rehabilitation and repair
          work, as well as replacement housing financed with HPG assistance.
          After all HPG work has been completed, a final inspection must be done
          by a disinterested third party, such as local building and code
          enforcement officials. If there are no such officials serving the area
          where HPG activities will be undertaken, or if the grantee would also
          normally make such inspections, the grantee must use qualified
          contract or fee inspectors.

             In the event more than one preapplication receives the same amount
            of points, those preapplications will then be ranked based on the
            actual percentage figure used for determining the points under
            paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Further, in the event that
            preapplications are still tied, then those preapplications still
            tied will be ranked based on the percentage figures used (low to
            high) in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Further, for applications
            where assistance to rental properties or co-ops is proposed, those
            still tied will be further ranked based on the number of years the
            units are available for occupancy under the program (a minimum of 5
            years is required). For this part, ranking will be based from most
            to least number of years. Finally, if there is still a tie, then a
            “lottery” System will be used.

           may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirements of
          this subpart not required by the authorizing statute if the
          Administrator finds that application of such requirement would
          adversely affect the interest of the Government, or adversely affect
          the accomplishment of the purposes of the HPG program, or result in
          undue hardship by applying the requirement. The Administrator or the
          Assistant Administrator for Housing may exercise this exception
          authority at the request of the State Director. The request must be
          supported by information demonstrating the adverse impact, citing the
          particular requirement involved, recommending proper alternative
          course(s) of action, and outlining how the adverse impact could be
          mitigated. Exception to any requirement may also be initiated by the
          Assistant Administrator for Housing.
