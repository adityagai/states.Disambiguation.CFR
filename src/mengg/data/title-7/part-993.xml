             For the purpose of obtaining nominations for producer members to
            represent independent producers, the Committee shall, with the
            approval of the Secretary, divide the area into districts giving,
            insofar as practicable, equal representation to numbers of
            independent producers and production of prune tonnage by such
            producers. 
            <PRTPAGE P='642' />
            The number of districts shall be equal to the number of such
            producer members or seven, whichever is the lesser. Candidates for
            nomination by independent producers from the various districts shall
            be obtained at meetings convened by the committee. Following such
            meetings, the committee shall prepare a separate ballot for each of
            the districts, or a joint ballot for two or more districts,
            containing (1) the names of the candidates for each district
            involved and (2) provision for write-in candidates. The ballot shall
            be mailed to each independent producer of record in each district.
            The voting procedure (including the casting of the ballot by mail
            addressed to the committee), and tabulation of votes shall be in
            accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the committee,
            with the approval of the Secretary. Each voter shall be entitled to
            cast only one vote for a member nominee and only one vote for an
            alternate member nominee in a district in which he is a producer,
            and no voter shall vote for candidates in more than one district. In
            case he is a producer in more than one district, he shall elect in
            which of such districts he will vote and notify the committee as to
            his choice. Whenever the number of producer members to represent
            independent producers during the ensuing term of office is to exceed
            seven, one nominee shall be nominated by independent producers in
            each of the seven districts and an additional nominee for each
            member in excess of the seven members shall be nominated, without
            reference to districts, by such seven nominees. The committee shall
            recommend the establishment of districts, or any changes therein, to
            the Secretary prior to January 31 of each year in which nominations
            are made.

            by cooperative marketing associations engaged in the handling of
            prunes. The number of cooperative producer members and handler
            members to be nominated by each cooperative marketing association
            shall bear, as near as practicable, the same percentage as each
            cooperative marketing association&apos;s tonnage of prunes handled
            as first handler thereof is to the total tonnage handled by all
            cooperative marketing associations during the preceding crop year.

             The Secretary, on the basis of a recommendation of the committee or
            other information, may establish size regulations, pack
            specifications, or more restrictive grade regulations with respect
            to prunes that may be shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler
            if such action would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the
            act. If a more restrictive grade regulation is established in

            both natural condition prunes and processed prunes. When pack
            specifications are in effect, no handler shall ship prunes in
            consumer packages, unless such prunes are identified by an
            appropriate label, seal, stamp, or tag affixed to such container by
            the handler showing the size of prunes in the lot from which the
            container was packed. In order to effectuate such orderly marketing
            of prunes as will be in the public interest, whether prices are
            above or below parity, no handler shall use descriptive terms in a
            manner inconsistent with that set forth in this subpart or in any
            pack specifications or other regulation issued by the Secretary
            pursuant to this subpart.

            prunes, or any lot of mixed dried fruit containing French prunes for
            human consumption as mixed dried fruit, unless the average count of
            French prunes contained in any such lot is 100 or less per pound.
            However, under safeguards to be established by the Committee, any
            lot containing French prunes with an average size count of more than
            100 prunes per pound may be shipped to or disposed of in prune
            product outlets in which they lose their form and character as
            prunes by conversion prior to consumption. In determining whether
            any such lot conforms to this minimum size requirement, the
            following tolerance shall apply: In a sample of 100 ounces, the
            count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes shall not vary
            from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more

            recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and other
            available information, modify this tolerance for uniformity of size.

          information, that to establish the percentages of prunes for any crop
          year which shall be salable prunes and reserve prunes, respectively,
          or to modify the previously established percentages, would tend to
          effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall establish or
          modify such percentages. The salable and reserve percentages when
          applied to the natural condition weight of prunes, excluding the
          quantity of undersized prunes determined pursuant to

            on hand, refund or credit to handler accounts the aforesaid excess.

            unexpended in the possession of the committee at the termination of
            this part, shall be distributed in such manner as the Secretary may

          property, or claims have been transferred or delivered by the
          committee or the joint trustees, pursuant to this section, shall be
          subject to the same obligations imposed upon the members of the said

            portion thereof to a point where they are capable of being received
            by such handler shall, prior to proceeding with such drying or

            shall apply as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For
            each day on which a handler processes and packages high moisture
            content prunes, he shall furnish promptly to the inspector a signed
            statement and one copy showing the handler&apos;s name and address
            and the net weight of the total tonnage of high moisture content
            prunes processed and packaged by him on that day. The handler shall

            disposition order or other documents which shall show the date of
            each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference number
            thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or disposition.
            One copy of each document so furnished shall be required to be
            forwarded to the committee. Upon request of the committee a handler
            shall, within ten days thereafter, file with the committee a signed
            report on Form PMC 3.1 “Report of High Moisture Content Prunes”
            which shall contain the following information: (i) The date and the

            moisture content prunes delivered to the handler during the crop
            year to the date of the report; (iii) the total tonnage of high
            moisture content prunes shipped or otherwise disposed of by the
            handler during such period; (iv) the total tonnage of high moisture
            content prunes delivered to the handler during such period which
            were dried or dehydrated and received as prunes by the handler; and
            (v) the total tonnage of high moisture content prunes in the

            <PRTPAGE P='664' />
            sufficient quantity of undersized prunes held in storage to meet its
            remaining obligation; and the extension of time requested is not
            later than 60 days beyond the end of the crop year. Prior to making
            any such disposition, the handler shall obtain the Committee&apos;s
            approval of his application to do so. The handler&apos;s application
            to ship or otherwise make final disposition of any such undersized
            prunes shall be submitted on Form PMC 2.21 “Application for
            Permission to Dispose of Undersized Prunes” which shall set forth:
            (i) The name and address of the handler&apos;s vendee and the name
            and address of the consignee whether the same as or different from
            the vendee; (ii) the particular use to be made of the prunes; (iii)
            if such use is to be by a person other than the handler&apos;s
            vendee or the consignee, the name and address of such user; and (iv)
            the crop year or the period within, or portion of, the crop year
            during which shipment or other disposition is to be made. When the
            use or the name and address of the consignee or user are not known
            by the handler, the handler shall arrange for the submission of such
            information to the Committee. If use is to be by the handler, the
            application shall so indicate and shall set forth all applicable
            information. Each application for shipment shall be limited to the
            handler&apos;s vendee and the consignee, if different from the
            vendee, and to a specific user and use. Each application for final
            disposition for a particular use by the handler shall be limited to
            such handler and use. The Committee&apos;s approval of a
            handler&apos;s application shall be transmitted to the handler on
            Form PMC 2.31 “Permission to Dispose of Undersized Prunes.” In
            approving an application, the Committee shall specify the crop year
            or the period within, or the portion of, the crop year for which the
            approval is granted. When the use or name and address of the user or
            consignee are not known to the handler, the Committee shall not
            approve the application until it has been informed as to such use
            and user and consignee of the prunes. The requirements of

            , eligible diversion shall not apply to prune plums, which would
            not, under normal producer practices, be dried and delivered to a
            handler. On or before July 20 of each crop year when the Committee
            recommends a reserve pool and diversion program (except the
            Committee with the approval of the Secretary may extend this date by
            not more than 10 business days if warranted by a late crop), the

            acceptable method(s) of voluntary prune plum diversion through
            reasonable publicity to producers, commercial dehydrators, handlers,
            and the cooperative bargaining association(s). For the purposes of

            issued. Prior to issuance of any such transferable certificate of

            Of the name of the handler to whom the transferable certificate of
            diversion is to be submitted and who is holding reserve prunes
            referable to prunes received from such producer; and (ii) how much
            of the quantity shown on his report of diversion he desires to use
            in lieu of reserve prunes but not in excess of the quantity of
            reserve prunes referable to prunes received by the handler from such
            producer. The Committee shall enter on the transferable certificate
            of diversion the name of the handler and the quantity covered by the
            certificate. The transferable certificate of diversion shall be
            endorsed by the producer and the handler prior to its return to the
            Committee in order to be credited by the Committee against such
            handler&apos;s reserve obligation. If any portion of the quantity
            shown on the producer&apos;s report of diversion remains unused and
            he desires to transfer a transferable certificate of diversion
            covering all or any part of such unused portion to another producer,
            he shall advise the Committee, in writing, of the name and address
            of such producer, together with the applicable quantity desired to
            be covered by the transfer, and, if known, the name of the handler
            to whom such a transferable certificate is to be submitted. However,
            the quantity to be covered by the transfer shall not exceed the
            quantity of reserve prunes referable to prunes received by the
            handler from the transferee-producer. The Committee shall enter on
            the transferable certificate of diversion the names of the
            transferee-producer and the handler, and the quantity covered by the
            certificate. Prior to submission of any such transferred diversion
            certificate to a handler, the transferee-producer shall advise the
            Committee, in writing, of the name and address of the handler to
            whom the transferable certificate is to be submitted and who is
            holding reserve prunes referable to prunes received from such
            producer. Such transferred diversion certificate shall be endorsed
            by both producers and the handler in order to be credited by the
            Committee against such handler&apos;s reserve obligation.

          The size category of the prunes in any lot shall be clearly marked by
          the handler on each consumer package of such prunes, on the parts or
          panels of the package or label which are normally presented in retail
          display, in terms of the applicable numerical or nomenclature

          conspicuousness. Any handler may, at his option, clearly mark on such
          consumer package additional information describing in numerical terms
          the average size count, or particular range of size counts, of the
          prunes in such lot so long as such numerical terms fall within the
          range of the size counts of the applicable numerical or nomenclature
          designation and do not tend to be deceptive as to the actual average
          size count, or range of the size counts, of the prunes in such lot.

          designation or words of like connotation, describing the style of
          pack, variety of prune, or other item of commercial significance may
          also be marked on the consumer package. Prunes in any lot of which the
          maximum size count is less than 25 shall be clearly marked by the
