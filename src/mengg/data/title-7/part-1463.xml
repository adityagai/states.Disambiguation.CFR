          far in advance of when the first assessment is due as CCC determines
          to be practicable. Based upon the amount of assessments received and

          national assessment for one or more classes of tobacco established for
          a particular year with respect to succeeding calendar year quarters.

            has determined it will incur in the 2005 through 2014 calendar

            calendar year quarter. If prior to 30 calendar days before the end

            amount that is required to be remitted in that quarter, no interest

            calendar days have elapsed from the date CCC provided notification

            provide information required to be filed under this subpart, or that

            subject to assessment of a civil penalty by CCC. Such civil penalty

            disruption the action has caused with respect to other parties
            subject to this subpart. Any such civil penalty will not exceed two

             During each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2014, CCC will make a
            payment to each eligible quota holder in an amount equal to 10
            percent of the total amount due under a contract entered into under
            this subpart, except that in the case an application was filed after
            June 17, 2005, the applicant will receive only the TTPP payments
            that have not been made as of the date the contract is approved.
            However, in order for the contract participant to receive the 2005
            TTPP payment an application to enter into a TTPP contract must be
            filed no later than June 17, 2005. CCC may, in its discretion,
            extend any deadline set forth in this paragraph. However, CCC will
            make the FY 2005 payment between June and September of 2005, and
            subsequent payments will be made in January, to the extent
            practicable, of each FY.
