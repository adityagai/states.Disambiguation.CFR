           Meals, Ready-To-Eat are complete portions of one meal for one
          military person and are processed and packaged to destroy or retard
          the growth of spoilage-type microorganisms in order to extend product
          shelf life for 7 years. Composition analyses for MRE&apos;s are
          covered by the reimbursable agreement in the Memorandums of
          Understanding (MOU&apos;s) between AMS, USDA and the Defense Personnel
          Support Center, Department of Defense (DOD). These DOD, Defense
          Personnel Support Center (DPSC) contracts state certain military
          specifications for an acceptable one meal serving, retorted pouched or
          18-24 serving hermetically-sealed tray packed meat, or meal product
          regarding satisfactory analyses for fat, salt, protein, moisture
          content, added stabilizer ingredient, and sometimes microbiological
          composition. MRE&apos;s are for use by the DOD, DPSC as a component of
          operational food rations, and as an item of general issue by the
          military.

          A laboratory that has met the requirements for certification specified
          in this subpart shall receive an AMS Science and Technology
          certificate to approve its analysis for 
          <E T='03'>
            Trichinella
          </E>
           spiralis in horsemeat. Certification would be granted to a qualified
          analyst or a laboratory based on having the proper training,
          facilities, and equipment. This AMS laboratory certification program
          will enable horsemeat exporters to comply with trichinae testing
          requirements of the European Community.

           A small parasitic nematode worm which lives in the flesh of various
          animals, including the horse. When such infected meat is inadequately
          cooked and eaten by man, the live worm multiplies within the body and
          the larvae burrow their way into the muscles, causing a disease
          referred to as trichinosis.
