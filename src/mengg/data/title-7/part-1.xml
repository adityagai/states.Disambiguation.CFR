            over a short period of time from a few requesters. Agencies may
            remove a record from this access medium when the appropriate
            official determines that it is unlikely there will be substantial
            further requests for that document.

            titles, names of individuals, names of offices, and names of
            agencies or other organizations that may help identify the records.
            If the request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the

          Aggregating requests.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          When an agency reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of
          requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down
          into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of
          fees, the agency may aggregate any such requests and charge
          accordingly. One element that may be considered in determining whether
          such a belief would be reasonable is the brevity of the time period
          during which the requests have been made.

            government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged in
            disseminating information. Representatives of the news media would
            normally qualify as individuals primarily engaged in disseminating

            information to the public as a whole, and not just a particular
            segment or group. “Urgency” contemplates that the information has a
            particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly.
            Ordinarily this means a breaking news story of general public
            interest. Information of historical interest only or information
            sought for litigation or commercial activities would not meet the
            test of urgency, nor would a news media publication or broadcast

          Search services are services of agency personnel—clerical or
          professional—used in trying to find the records, that are responsive
          to a request. Search services includes both manual and electronic
          searches and time spent examining records for the purpose of finding
          information that is within the scope of the request. Search services
          also include services to transport personnel to places of record
          storage, or records to the location of personnel for the purpose of
          the search, if such services are reasonably necessary.

          Each USDA agency is responsible for making the final determination
          with regard to the disclosure or nondisclosure of information in
          agency records that has been submitted by a business. When, in the
          course of responding to an FOIA request, an agency cannot readily
          determine whether the information obtained from a person is privileged
          or confidential business information, the policy of USDA is to obtain
          and consider the views of the submitter of the information and to
          provide the submitter an opportunity to object to any decision to
          disclose the information. If a request (including a subpoena duces
          tecum as described in 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            of a request for that information (unless it is readily determined

            or, on the other hand, that the information is not exempt by law
            from disclosure). Afford business information submitter reasonable
            time in which to object to the disclosure of any specified portion
            of the information. The submitter must explain fully all grounds
            upon which disclosure is opposed. For example, if the submitter
            maintains that disclosure is likely to cause substantial harm to it
            competitive position, the submitter must explain item-by-item why
            disclosure would cause such harm. Information provided by a business
            submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to
            disclosure under FOIA;

             When releasing documents, agencies shall provide the record in any
            form or format the requester specifies, if the record is readily
            reproducible in that form of format. Agencies shall make reasonable
            efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats that are
            reproducible. In responding to requests for records, agencies shall
            make reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form or
            format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with
            the operation of an agency&apos;s automated information system. Such
            determinations shall be made on a case-by-case basis.

             In the event a requested record contains some portions that are
            exempt from mandatory disclosure and others that are not, the
            official responding to the request shall ensure that all reasonably
            segregable nonexempt portions are disclosed, and that all exempt
            portions are identified according to the specific exemption or
            exemptions which are applicable. The amount of deleted information
            shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records.
            Deletions may be marked by use of brackets or darkened areas
            indicating removal of information, or by any other method that would
            reasonable demonstrate the extent of the deletion. In the case of
            electronic deletion, or deletion in audiovisual or microfiche
            records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted information
            shall be indicated at the place in the records, if technically
            feasible, the amount of redacted information shall be indicated at
            the place in the record where such deletion was made. This may be
            done by use of brackets, shaded areas, or some other identifiable
            technique which will clearly show the limits of the deleted
            information.

            or a portion of the fee, before it provides the requested records.
            An agency shall require full payment of any delinquent fee owed by
            the requester plus any applicable interest prior to releasing
            records on a subsequent request or appeal. If a requester refuses to
            remit payment in advance, an agency may refuse to process the
            request or appeal with written notice to that effect forwarded to
            the requester. The “date of receipt” appeal for which advance
            payment has been required shall be the date that payment is
            received.

             In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, when
            additional time is needed to respond to the initial request or to an
            appeal, agencies shall acknowledge the request or the appeal in
            writing within the 20 working day time period, describe the unusual
            circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the anticipated date
            for a substantive response that may not exceed 10 additional working
            days, except as provided in the following:

             In instances in which the agency, with respect to a particular
            request, has extended the response date by 10 additional working
            days, if the agency finds that it cannot make a response
            determination within the additional 10 working day period, the
            agency shall notify the requester and provide the requester an
            opportunity to limit the scope of the request to allow the agency to
            process the request within the extended time limit, or an
            alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified

             If the requester refuses to reasonably modify the request or
            arrange for an alternative time frame for processing the request,
            the FOIA provides that such refusal shall be considered as a factor
            in determining whether there are exceptional circumstances that
            warrant granting additional time for the agency to complete its

            rich source of materials on public services, often dramatic and
            interesting for their human values, which are suitable for

            the interest of television film producers in its activities and

            factual information to such producers, as it does to representatives
            of other media. As its resources will permit, the Department will
            work with producers at their request, to assure technical accuracy
            of scripts and story treatments.

          The Department and its agencies may lend special assistance on
          television films when it is clearly evident that public interests are
          served. Where special assistance is sought, an individual cooperative
          agreement will be drawn up between the Department with the Director of
          Information as its agent, and the producer. Details on such assistance
          as reviewing stories and scripts, loan of material, arrangements for
          locations, use of official motion picture footage, assignment of
          technical advisors and similar aids will be covered in the agreement,

             should acknowledge the request or appeal within 10 days of its
            receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).
            Wherever practicable, the acknowledgment should indicate whether or
            not access will be granted and, if so, when and where. When access
            is to be granted, the agency should provide the access within 30
            days of receipt of the request or appeal (excluding Saturdays,
            Sundays and legal public holidays) unless, for good cause shown, it
            is unable to do so. If the agency is unable to meet this deadline,
            it shall inform the requester of this fact, the reasons for its
            inability to do so, and an estimate of the date on which access will
            be granted.

          was provided copies instead at the discretion of the agency.

          At any time before the Judge files the decision, the parties may agree
          to the entry of a consent decision. Such agreement shall be filed with
          the Hearing Clerk in the form of a decision signed by the parties with
          appropriate space for signature by the Judge, and shall contain an
          admission of at least the jurisdictional facts, consent to the
          issuance of the agreed decision without further procedure and such
          other admissions or statements as may be agreed between the parties.
          The Judge shall enter such decision without further procedure, unless
          an error is apparent on the face of the document. Such decision shall
          have the same force and effect as a decision issued after full
          hearing, and shall become final upon issuance to become effective in
          accordance with the terms of the decision.

          The failure to file an answer, or the admission by the answer of all
          the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, shall
          constitute a waiver of hearing. Upon such admission or failure to
          file, complainant shall file a proposed decision, along with a motion
          for the adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon the
          respondent by the Hearing Clerk. Within 20 days after service of such
          motion and proposed decision, the respondent may file with the Hearing
          Clerk objections thereto. If the Judge finds that meritorious
          objections have been filed, complainant&apos;s Motion shall be denied
          with supporting reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the
          Judge shall issue a decision without further procedure or hearing.
          Copies of the decision or denial of complainant&apos;s Motion shall be
          served by the Hearing Clerk upon each of the parties and may be
          appealed pursuant to

          decision shall become final and effective without further proceedings

             Any party may request a hearing on the facts by including such
            request in the complaint or answer, or by a separate request, in
            writing, filed with the Hearing Clerk within the time in which an
            answer may be filed. A petition for review shall be deemed a request
            for a hearing. Failure to request a hearing within the time allowed
            for the filing of the answer shall constitute a waiver of such
            hearing. Waiver of hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the
            right to request oral argument before the Judicial Officer upon
            appeal of the Judge&apos;s decision. In the event the respondent
            denies any material fact and fails to file a timely request for a
            hearing, the matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the
            complainant or upon the Judge&apos;s own motion.

             As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the

            practicable thereafter, the Judicial Officer, upon the basis of and
            after due consideration of the record and any matter of which
            official notice is taken, shall rule on the appeal. If the Judicial
            Officer decides that no change or modification of the Judge&apos;s
            decision is warranted, the Judicial Officer may adopt the
            Judge&apos;s decision as the final order in the proceeding,
            preserving any right of the 
            <PRTPAGE P='48' />
            party bringing the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision
            in the proper forum. A final order issued by the Judicial Officer
            shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Such order may be regarded by
            the respondent as final for purposes of judicial review without
            filing a petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of
            the decision of the Judicial Officer.

          <text>
             Within 20 days following the service of any petition provided for
            in this section, any party to the proceeding may file with the
            Hearing Clerk a reply thereto. As soon as practicable thereafter,
            the Judge or the Judicial Officer, as the case may be, shall
            announce the determination whether to grant or deny the petition.
            The decision of the Judicial Officer shall automatically be stayed
            pending the determination to grant or deny a timely petition. Such
            decision shall not be final for purposes of judicial review until
            the petition is denied or the decision is affirmed or modified
            pursuant to the petition and the time for judicial review shall
            begin to run upon the filing of such final action on the petition.
            In the event that any such petition is granted, the applicable rules
            of practice, as set out elsewhere herein, shall be followed. A
            person filing a petition under this section shall be regarded as the
            moving party, although such person shall be referred to as the
            complainant or respondent, depending upon the designation in the
            original proceeding.

             A deposition ordered and taken in accordance with the provisions of
            this section may be used in a proceeding under these rules if the
            Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and (1) that
            the witness is dead; (2) that the witness is unable to attend or
            testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; (3)
            that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the
            attendance of the witness by subpoena, but has been unable to do so;
            or (4) that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it
            desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to
            be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken
            refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the
            deposition or any part thereof in evidence. If only part of a
            deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may
            require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness
            to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may
            introduce any other parts.

           (called “EAJA” in this subpart), provides for the award of attorney
          fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are
          parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary
          adjudications”) before the Department. An eligible party may receive
          an award when it prevails over the Department unless the position of
          the Department was substantially justified or special circumstances
          make an award unjust. Alternatively, an eligible party may receive an
          award in connection with an adversary adjudication arising from an
          agency action to enforce the party&apos;s 
          <PRTPAGE P='62' />
          compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement where the demand
          by the agency is substantially in excess of the decision of the
          adjudicative officer and is unreasonable when compared with such
          decision under the facts and circumstances of the case. The rules in
          this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the
          proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for
          awards, and the procedures and standards that the Department will use
          to make awards.

            award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the

          The adjudicative officer or Board of Contract Appeals shall issue an
          initial decision on the application as expeditiously as possible after
          completion of proceedings on the application. Whenever possible, the
          decision shall be made by the same administrative judge or panel that
          decided the contract appeal for which fees are sought. The decision
          shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant&apos;s
          eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of
          the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the
          amount awarded. This decision also shall include, if at issue,
          findings on whether the position of the Department was substantially
          justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or
          whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant
          has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall
          allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the
          agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.

             In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and
            assessments, the ALJ and the judicial officer, upon appeal, should
            evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation
            and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the
            penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible
            costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the
            need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily
            double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.

             A deposition ordered and taken in accordance with the provisions of
            this section may be used in a proceeding under these rules if the
            Judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and that the
            witness is dead; that the witness is unable to attend or testify
            because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or that such
            exceptional circumstances exist 
            <PRTPAGE P='98' />
            as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the
            deposition to be used. If the party upon whose motion the deposition
            was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer
            the deposition or any thereof in evidence. If only part of a
            deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may
            require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness
            to be considered with the part introduced and any party may
            introduce any other parts.

          Yes. This rule contains provisions that would collect information from
          the public. It therefore requires approval by the Office of Management
          and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995,

           (PRA). According to the PRA, a Federal agency may not conduct or
          sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of
          information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number
          that indicates OMB approval. OMB has reviewed the information
          collection in this rule and approved it under OMB control number
          1094-0001.
