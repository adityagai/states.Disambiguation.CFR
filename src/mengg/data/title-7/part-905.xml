             If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in

             The committee may investigate the handling of special purpose
            shipments under Certificates of Privilege to determine whether
            Special Purpose Shippers are complying with the requirements and
            regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee
            finds that a Special Purpose Shipper or consignee is failing to
            comply with the requirements and regulations applicable to such
            certificates, the Certificate of Privilege issued to such Special
            Purpose Shipper may be suspended or, in the case of an application
            for the issuance of an initial Certificate of Privilege, may be
            denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be for a reasonable
            period of time as determined by the committee, but in no event shall
            it extend beyond the end of the current fiscal period. In the case
            of the denial of an application for the issuance of an initial
            certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant
            comes into compliance with the requirements and regulations
            applicable to such certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an
            application for a Certificate of Privilege, the committee shall give
            the shipper or applicant reasonable advance notice in writing of its
            intention and the facts and reasons therefor, and afford the shipper
            or applicant an opportunity, either orally or in writing, to present
            opposing facts and reasons. The shipper or applicant shall be
            informed of the committee&apos;s determination in writing and in a
            timely manner.

            sound and wholesome citrus fruit which has not been separated either
            as to grade or size after severance from the tree.” Wholesomeness is
            as defined in FDOC regulation 20-62.002. The tree run citrus fruit
            shipped under this provision also must be from the applying
            grower&apos;s own grove.

             The committee may investigate the handling of tree run shipments
            under a Grower Tree Run Certificate to determine whether growers are
            complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such
            certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a grower is failing
            to comply with the requirements and regulations applicable to such
            certificates, the Grower Tree Run Certificate issued to such grower
            may be suspended or, in the case of an application for the issuance
            of an initial Grower Tree Run Certificate, may be denied. Such
            suspension of a certificate shall be for a reasonable period of time
            as determined by the committee, but in no event shall it extend
            beyond the end of the fiscal period. In the case of the denial of an
            application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such
            certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes into
            compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such
            certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an application for a
            Grower Tree Run Certificate, the committee shall give the grower

            and reasons therefor, and afford the grower an opportunity, either
            orally or in writing, to present opposing facts and reasons. The
            grower shall be informed of the committee&apos;s determination in

             is hereby established as an average week within the immediately
            preceding three seasons. Each handler&apos;s average week shall be
            computed by adding the total volume of red seedless grapefruit
            handled in the immediately preceding three seasons and dividing the
            total by 99. The average week for handlers with less than three
            previous seasons of shipments shall be calculated by adding the
            total volume of shipments for the seasons they did ship red seedless
            grapefruit, divide by the number of seasons, divide further by 33.
            If crop conditions limit shipments from any or all of the
            immediately preceding three season(s), the committee may use a prior
            season or seasons for the purposes of calculating an average week.
            New handlers with no record of shipments could ship size 48 and 56
            red seedless grapefruit as a percentage of total shipments equal to
            the percentage applied to other handlers&apos; average week; once
            such handlers have recorded shipments, their average week shall be
            calculated as an average of total shipments for the weeks they have
            shipped red seedless grapefruit during the current season. When used
            in the regulation of red seedless grapefruit, the term season means
            the weeks beginning the third Monday in September and ending the
            first Sunday in the following May. The term

             The committee may investigate the handling of repacked fresh citrus
            fruit shipments under certificates of privilege to determine whether
            repacking shippers are complying with the requirements and
            regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee
            finds that a repacking shipper is failing to comply with the
            requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates, the
            certificate of privilege issued to such repacking shipper may be
            suspended or, in the case of an application for the issuance of an
            initial certificate of privilege, may be denied. Such suspension of
            a certificate shall be for a reasonable period of time as determined
            by the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of
            the then current fiscal period. In the case of the denial of an
            application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such
            certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes into
            compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such
            certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an application for a
            certificate of privilege, the committee shall give the shipper or
            applicant an opportunity, either orally or in writing, to present
            opposing facts and reasons. The shipper or applicant shall be
            informed of the committee&apos;s determination in writing and in a
            timely manner.
