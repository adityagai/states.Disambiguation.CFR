             To participate in WRP, a landowner must agree to the implementation
            of a WRPO, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance,
            maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or
            saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of
            eligible lands. NRCS may provide cost-share assistance through a
            restoration cost-share agreement or an easement restoration
            agreement for the conservation practices and activities that promote
            the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and
            management of wetland functions and values. For easement
            transactions, NRCS may implement such conservation practices and
            activities through an agreement with the landowner, a contract with
            a vendor, or a cooperative agreement with a cooperating entity.
            Specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and
            management actions may be undertaken by the landowner, NRCS, or

             NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the

             The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land shall
            be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to
            accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO will be developed to
            ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife
            benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically,
            the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the
            on-site alternations and the off-site watershed conditions that
            adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife and wetland
            functions and values. NRCS will review, revise, and supplement the
            WRPO as needed throughout the duration of the enrollment to ensure
            that 
            <PRTPAGE P='822' />
            program goals are fully and effectively achieved.

             USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by
            implementing conservation practices and activities funded through
            WRP, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of
            implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a WRP
            easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement.
            NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits.
            However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that the requirements
            of the WRPO, contract, and easement deed are met. Where activities
            required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land
            covered under a WRP easement, 30-year contract, or restoration
            cost-share agreement, participants are highly encouraged to request
            a compatibility assessment from NRCS prior to entering into such
            agreements.
