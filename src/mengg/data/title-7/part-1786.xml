             The determination of the order or method in which applications or
            portions of applications will be processed by RUS pursuant to this
            subpart rests solely within the discretion of the Administrator. RUS
            expects that a number of prepayment applications will be processed
            simultaneously. In the event that it becomes necessary to establish
            priorities of processing, prepayment applications will be processed
            without regard to the date received, generally in the following
            order of priority:

             Applications from all other borrowers. When assigning priority to
            such applications, RUS will consider a number of factors, including
            without limitation, (i) the number of prepayment applications being
            processed by the area office; (ii) the novelty or complexity of the
            proposed transaction; (iii) the method of prepayment; and (iv) the
            availability of resources. In the event that RUS receives during the
            initial application period, prepayment applications from such
            borrowers in an amount less than remaining prepayment authority for
            each respective program, RUS will establish a new application period

          If, after prepayment of RUS Notes, the Government should continue to
          hold liens on the borrower&apos;s property that secure loans made or
          guaranteed pursuant to the Act, the Administrator of RUS or the
          Governor of the Rural Telephone Bank, as the case may be, will
          consider request for the accommodation of such liens for the purpose
          of providing security for loans the proceeds of which were used to
          prepay RUS Notes. Such lien accommodations shall be limited in amount
          to the Discounted Present Value of the RUS Notes plus such costs, as
          the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, incurred by the
          borrower in obtaining such loans.

        <P>
          There were 29 former RUS electric borrowers that prepaid their direct
          or insured loans under 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            section 306B(a) of
          </aref>
           the Act prior to October 1, 1987. (See subpart C of this part.) These
          borrowers are listed in appendix A to subpart E of this part. Any RUS
          electric borrower which is the result of a merger or consolidation
          involving any of these 29 former borrowers and a borrower with
          outstanding Notes may, after meeting all requirements of this subpart,
          prepay all outstanding RUS Notes issued or assumed by the borrower
          upon paying the lesser of the outstanding balance or the Discounted
          Present Value. Such prepayment must be made not later than one year
          after the effective date of the merger or consolidation.

             The Discounted Present Value shall be calculated by RUS before
            prepayment is made by summing the present values of all remaining
            payments on all outstanding notes according to the following formula
            to compute the discounted present value of each note and adjusting
            as here and after provided for tax exempt financing.

            the power supplier and the Administrator, take or suffer to be taken

            with or merge into any corporation or any other public power
            district, or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement
            therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now
            owned or hereafter acquired, so long as the borrower shall pay such
            portion of the outstanding indebtedness evidenced by the power
            supplier&apos;s Notes at the time outstanding as shall be determined
            by the power supplier with the prior written consent of the

             If the borrower is a party to a wholesale power contract with a
            power supply borrower financed pursuant to the RE Act, the
            Administrator may require that the borrower and the power supply
            borrower enter into a supplement to the outstanding wholesale power
            contract providing substantially as follows:

            So long as any of the notes evidencing secured loans of the power
            supply borrower are outstanding, the borrower will not, without the
            approval in writing of the power supply borrower and the
            Administrator, take or suffer to be taken any steps for
            reorganization or dissolution, or to consolidate with or merge into
            any corporation, or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any
            agreement therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets,
            whether now owned or hereafter acquired. The power supply borrower
            will not unreasonably withhold or condition its consent to any such,
            reorganization, dissolution, consolidation, or merger, or to any
            such sale, lease or transfer (or any agreement therefor) of assets.
            The power supply borrower will not withhold or condition such
            consent except in cases where to do otherwise would result in rate

            loans in accordance with their terms, or adversely affect system
            performance in a material way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
            borrower may take or suffer to be taken any steps for reorganization
            or dissolution or to consolidate with or merge into any corporation
            or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement therefor) all
            or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now owned or
            hereafter acquired without the power supply borrower&apos;s consent,

            indebtedness on the power supply borrower&apos;s notes or other
            obligations as shall be determined by the power supply borrower with
            the prior written consent of the Administrator and shall otherwise
            comply with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
            Administrator and power supply borrower may require either: (1) To
            eliminate any adverse effect that such action seems likely to have
            on the rates of the other members of the power supply borrower, or
          </P>
          <P>
            (2) To assure that the power supply borrower&apos;s ability to repay

            in accordance with their terms is not impaired.

            of the power supply borrower&apos;s indebtedness on Notes shall be
            paid by the borrower in the manner necessary to accomplish a
            defeasance of those obligations in accordance with the loan

             The Administrator may exempt a borrower from the requirement to
            enter into a supplement to its outstanding wholesale power contract
            if the Administrator determines that such requirement is burdensome
            and unnecessary in light of the provisions of the existing wholesale

          In the event that a borrower shall prepay all its outstanding electric

          closing transactions involving the RUS Construction Fund Account
          established and maintained by the borrower pursuant to the terms of
          the RUS Loan Contract and to inspect all books, records, accounts, and
          other documents and papers of the borrower. Should RUS determine that
          the borrower has made disbursements of funds advanced pursuant to the
          RUS Loan Contracts which do not comply with the requirements thereof,
          the borrower shall be required to pay the RUS an amount equal to the
          difference between the amount which the borrower prepaid under this
          subpart with respect to such advances, and the amount which the
          borrower would otherwise have been required to return to the RUS as a
          result of noncompliance if the borrower had not prepaid such advances,
          plus interest. (See

             No borrower that prepays an electric loan at a discount as provided
            under this subpart may apply for or receive direct or insured loans
            during the 120 months from the most recent closing date, except at
            the discretion of the Administrator. During the 120 month period the
            Administrator may consider providing an insured loan if, among other
            matters, it is necessary to assure repayment of, or protect the
            Government&apos;s security for any outstanding loans or loan
            guarantees, or the borrower&apos;s system has suffered severe
            physical plant related damage due to conditions beyond its control
            and the borrower is unable to obtain financing at reasonable terms
            to restore the system from non-RUS sources, including the Federal
            Emergency Management Agency, and from private sources. Upon
            expiration of the 120 months, such borrowers may apply for direct or
            insured loans in the same manner as other borrowers provided that
            such borrowers may not apply for direct or insured loans for
            facilities, construction of which commenced prior to the expiration
            of the 120 months. Special provisions for mergers involving a
