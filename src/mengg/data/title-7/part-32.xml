            A certified sample consists of grease mohair randomly selected from
            a bulk sample. The measured average and standard deviation of fiber
            diameter of bulk sample were within the limits corresponding to the
            grade of the standard sample as set forth in the voluntary U.S.
            grade standards. Copies of the voluntary U.S. grade standards can be
