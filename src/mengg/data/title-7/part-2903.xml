          The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program seeks to familiarize public and 
          <PRTPAGE P='109' />
          private vehicle fleet operators, other interested entities, and the
          public, with the benefits of biodiesel, a relatively new fuel option
          in the United States. It will also address concerns previously
          identified by fleet operators and other potential users of this
          alternative fuel, including the need to balance the positive
          environmental, social and human health impacts of biodiesel
          utilization with the increased per gallon cost to the user. It is the
          Program&apos;s goal to stimulate biodiesel demand and encourage the
          further development of a biodiesel industry in the United States.

             For the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, applicants should use the
            current indirect cost rate negotiated with the cognizant Federal
            negotiating agency. Indirect costs may not exceed the negotiated
            rate. If no indirect cost rate has been negotiated, a reasonable
            dollar amount for indirect costs may be requested, which will be
            subject to approval by USDA. In the latter case, if a proposal is
            recommended for funding, an indirect cost rate proposal must be
            submitted prior to award to support the amount of indirect costs
            requested.

             A proposer may elect not to charge indirect costs and, instead,
            charge only direct costs to grant funds. Grantees electing this
            alternative will not be allowed to charge, as direct costs, indirect
            costs that otherwise would be in the grantee&apos;s indirect cost
            pool under the applicable Office of Management and Budget cost
            principles. Grantees who request no indirect costs will not be
            permitted to revise their budgets at a later date to charge indirect
            costs to grant funds.

          OEPNU intends to award continuation grants to successful Biodiesel
          Fuel Education Program applicants. A continuation grant is a grant
          instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level
          of effort for a predetermined project period with a statement of
          intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided
          that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available
          for this purpose, and continued government support would be in the
          best interest of the Federal government and the public. If these three
          elements are met, OEPNU plans to provide additional support to the
          funded project(s).

             During the peer evaluation process, extreme care will be taken to
            prevent any actual or perceived conflicts of interest that may
            impact review or evaluation. Determinations of conflicts of interest
            will be based on the academic and administrative autonomy of an
            institution. The program announcement will specify the methodology
            for determining such autonomy.

             Names of submitting institutions and individuals, as well as
            application content and peer evaluations, will be kept confidential,
            except to those involved in the review process, to the extent
            permitted by law. In addition, the identities of peer reviewers will
            remain confidential throughout the entire review process. Therefore,
            the names of the reviewers will not be released to applicants. At
            the end of the fiscal year, names of reviewers will be made
            available in such a way that the reviewers cannot be identified with
            the review of any particular application.

          ADO as the effective date of the grant shall be no later than
          September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is
          approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose,
          unless otherwise permitted by law. It should be noted that the project
          need not be initiated on the grant effective date, but as soon
          thereafter as practical so that project goals may be attained within
          the funded project period. All funds granted by OEPNU under this

          When an application results in an award, it becomes a part of the
          record of USDA transactions, available to the public upon specific
          request. Information that the Secretary determines to be of a
          confidential, privileged, or proprietary nature will be held in
          confidence to the extent permitted by law. Therefore, any information
          that the applicant wishes to have considered as confidential,
          privileged, or proprietary should be clearly marked within the
          application. The original copy of an application that does not result
          in an award will be retained by the Agency for a period of one year.
          Other copies will be destroyed. Such an application will be released
          only with the consent of the applicant or to the extent required by
          law. An application may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final
          action thereon.
