          ). These agreements are neither procurement nor assistance in nature,
          and therefore, are not subject to the Federal Grant and Cooperative
          Agreements Act of 1977. Accordingly, proper use of these cooperative
          agreements will promote and facilitate partnerships between the REE
          Agency and the Cooperator in support of research, extension and
          education projects of mutual benefit to each party.

          Mutual interest exists when both parties benefit in the same

          For each kind of Cooperator, there is a set of Federal principles for
          determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined
          in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity
          incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State,
          local or federally recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
          in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost
          Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments” codified
          at 
          <aref type='CFR'>

              225
            </subref>
          </aref>
          . The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is
          determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122,
          “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations” codified at 
          <aref type='CFR'>

          </aref>
          . The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher
          education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB
          Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions” codified
          at 
          <aref type='CFR'>
            2 CFR 220
          </aref>
          . The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in
          accordance with the provisions of subpart E of 
          <aref type='CFR'>
            45 CFR part

             Cooperators are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations
            of REE nonassistance awards using their established controls and
            policies, as long as they are consistent with REE requirements.
            However, in order to fulfill their role in regard to the stewardship
            of Federal funds, REE Agencies monitor their agreements to identify
            potential problems and areas where technical assistance might be
            necessary. This active monitoring is accomplished through review of
            reports and correspondence from the cooperator, audit reports, site
            visits, and other information available to the REE Agency. It is the
            responsibility of the Cooperator to ensure that the project is being
            performed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the award.

             Monitoring of a project or activity will continue for as long as

            it has been administratively closed out and no longer providing

            uses provided that compensation is made to the original REE Agency

            Agency. The REE Agency shall determine whether the equipment can be
            used to meet the Agency&apos;s requirements. If no requirement

            be reported to the General Services Administration (GSA) by the REE
            Agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists

            to the Cooperator no later than 120 calendar days after the
            Cooperator&apos;s request and the following procedures shall govern.

            request for research data relating to published research findings
            produced under a cooperative agreement that were used by the Federal

            they can be made available to the public through the procedures
            established under the FOIA. If the REE Agency obtains the research
            data solely in response to a FOIA request, the Agency may charge the
            requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of
            obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred
            by the Agency, the Cooperator, and applicable subrecipients. This
            fee is in addition to any fees the Agency may assess under the FOIA

          The Cooperator shall maintain written standards of conduct governing
          the performance of its employees engaged in the award and
          administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall
          participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract
          supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest
          would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee,
          officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or
          her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ
          any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest
          in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents
          of the Cooperator shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors,
          or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to
          subagreements. However, Cooperators may set standards for situations
          in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an
          unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall
          provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such
          standards by officers, employees, or agents of the Cooperator.

             Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a Cooperator
            resulting from obligations incurred by the Cooperator during a
            suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless
            the REE Agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension
            or termination or thereafter. Other Cooperator costs during
            suspension or after termination which are necessary and not
            reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of
            this section apply.

             The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by
            the Cooperator before the effective date of suspension or
            termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a
            termination, are non-cancellable.
