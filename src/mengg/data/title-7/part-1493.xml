        <P>
          This subpart sets forth the restrictions which apply to the use of
          credit guarantees under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export
          Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate Credit
          Guarantee Program (GSM-103) and the criteria considered by CCC in
          determining the annual allocations of credit guarantees to be made
          available with respect to each participating country. This subpart
          also sets forth the criteria considered by CCC in the review and
          approval of proposed allocation levels for GSM-102 and/or GSM-103
          credit guarantees which may be made available in connection with
          export sales of specific U.S. agricultural commodities to these
          countries. These restrictions and criteria are interrelated and will
          be applied and considered together in the process of determining which
          sales opportunities under GSM-102 or GSM-103 will best meet the
          purposes of the programs.

             This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of
            the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate
            Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103). The GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs
            of the Commodity Credit 
            <PRTPAGE P='949' />
            Corporation (CCC) were developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports
            by making available export credit guarantees to encourage U.S.
            private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural
            commodities on credit terms. Under GSM-102, credit guarantees are
            issued for terms of up to three years. Under GSM-103, credit
            guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten years.

             The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase
            or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S.
            financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing
            without CCC&apos;s guarantee. The programs are operated in a manner
            intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs
            are targeted toward those countries where the guarantees are
            necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have
            sufficient financial strength so that foreign exchange will be
            available for scheduled payments. In providing this credit guarantee
            facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for U.S.
            agricultural exporters and assist long-term market development for
            U.S. agricultural commodities.

             The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment
            guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement by CCC to pay the
            exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment
            of the exporter&apos;s right to proceeds, specified amounts of
            principal and interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank
            issuing an irrevocable letter of credit in connection with the
            export sale to which CCC&apos;s guarantee coverage pertains. By
            approving an exporter&apos;s application for a payment guarantee,
            CCC encourages private sector, rather than governmental, financing
            and incurs a substantial portion of the risk of default by the
            foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be able to operate
            the programs for the purposes specified in

             Typically, in export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities,
            payment by the importer is made under an irrevocable letter of
            credit. For the purpose of the GSM-102 and GSM-103 programs, CCC
            will consider applications for payment guarantees only in connection
            with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment
            for the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two
            following ways:

             An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of
            the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation specifically
            stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is
            obligated to make payment to the exporter, or the exporter&apos;s
            assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The exporter
            may assign the right to proceeds under the letter of credit or
            related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so
            that the exporter may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the
            deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign
            bank letter of credit or its related obligation. The GSM-102 and
            GSM-103 programs are designed to protect the exporter or the
            exporter&apos;s assignee against those losses specified in the
            payment guarantee resulting from defaults, whether for commercial or
            noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank obligated under the
            letter of credit or related obligation.

             From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to
            announce a GSM-102 and/or GSM-103 program allocation for a specific
            country. The Program Announcement for a country allocation will
            designate specific allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or
            products thereof. Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in
            that country for one of the commodities specified in the Program
            Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar
            amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program
            Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter&apos;s
            sales contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable
            program year. The final date for a contractual shipping deadline
            will be stated in the Program Announcement. Program Announcements
            may also contain a specified “undesignated” or “unallocated” dollar
            amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts specified for a
            specific commodity for a country become fully used, an additional
            allocation from the “unallocated” or “undesignated” portion of the
            total country allocation may then be designated for a specific
            commodity. Program Announcements that include an “allocated” or
            “undesignated” dollar amount will contain further information on the
            “unallocated” or “undesignated” portion of the country allocation.

             The exporter may apply for a payment guarantee and, if coverage is
            available, pay the guarantee fee, based at least on, the amount of
            the lower loading tolerance of the export sales contract; however,
            the exporter may 
            <PRTPAGE P='956' />
            also request that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to
            accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance
            specified in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee
            coverage is available at the time of application and CCC determines
            to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In
            the event that the exporter ships a quantity greater than the amount
            on which the guarantee fee was paid (
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.

            , lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional coverage
            from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by
            filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the
            additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the
            payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30
            days after the date of the last export against the sales contract,
            CCC may determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside
            for the exporter.

            CCC will consider such a request only if the amendment sought is
            consistent with this subpart and any applicable Program
            Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include,

            extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee,
            particularly those that result in an increase in CCC&apos;s
            liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in

            clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the
            exporter&apos;s assignee are not viewed as amendments.)

             If the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit fails to make
            payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank letter of credit
            or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee
            must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not
            later than 10 calendar days after the date that payment was due from
            the foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be
            submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified
            in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee
            fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this
            paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with
            respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time
            limit may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if
            such extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the
            best interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:

            favor of the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee beginning with

            in good order and continuing until and including the date that
            payment is made by CCC. Late interest will be paid on the guaranteed

            and will be calculated based on the average investment rate of the

            exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC
            by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its
            option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus
            accrued interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the
            exporter&apos;s assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as

            assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC

            rata basis determined by their respective interests in such
            recoveries. The respective interest of each party will be determined
            on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and
            interest in default. Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under
            a GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any collections
            it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the

            credit for agricultural commodities exported in connection with a
            GSM-102 or GSM-103 payment guarantee, including those records
            generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and
            related companies involved in special arrangements with the
            exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller General
            of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must
            be given full and complete access to the premises of the exporter or
            the exporter&apos;s assignee, as applicable, during regular business
            hours from the effective date of the payment guarantee until the
            expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and
            make copies of the exporter&apos;s, exporter&apos;s assignee&apos;s,

            and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and
            administrative and incidental costs, both normal and unforeseen.
            During such period, the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee may
            be required to make available to the Secretary of Agriculture or the
            Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized
            representatives, records that pertain to transactions conducted
            outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records
            would pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by
            the exporter in connection with the payment guarantee.

          This subpart governs the Commodity Credit Corporation&apos;s (CCC)
          Facility Guarantee Program (FGP). CCC will issue facility payment
          guarantees for project applications meeting the terms and conditions
          of the Facility Guarantee Program (FGP) and where private sector
          financing is otherwise not available. This subpart describes the
          criteria and procedures for applying for a facility payment guarantee,
          and contains the general terms and conditions of such a guarantee.
          These general terms and conditions may be supplemented by special
          terms and conditions specified in program announcements or notices to
          participants published prior to the issuance of a facility payment
          guarantee and, if so, will be incorporated by reference on the face of
          the facility payment guarantee issued by CCC.

             CCC will determine whether, in its judgment, the project in
            connection with which the exporter seeks a facility payment
            guarantee is likely to increase exports of U.S. agricultural
            commodities or products to an emerging market; and whether the
            project is likely to benefit primarily U.S. agricultural commodities
            or products as opposed to commodities or products originating in
            other countries. If necessary, CCC may seek additional information
            from an applicant prior to making its determination. If CCC
            determines that an application meets these standards and appears to
            represent, in CCC&apos;s judgment, the best use of available
            resources, CCC will respond to the applicant with a letter of
            preliminary commitment indicating CCC&apos;s interest in issuing a
            facility payment guarantee conditioned on its approval of the
            exporter&apos;s final application.

            guarantee. Amending the facility payment guarantee may result in an
            increase to the exposure fee. Requests made by the exporter to amend
            the facility payment guarantee so as to change the guaranteed value
            must have the concurrence of the assignee when an assignment has

             If the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit fails to make
            payment pursuant to the terms of the foreign bank letter of credit
            or related obligation, the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee
            must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not
            later than ten days after the date that payment was due from the
            foreign bank (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted
            in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the
            Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee fails
            to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this
            paragraph, CCC may make the facility payment guarantee null and void
            with respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time
            limit may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if
            approved by the Controller, CCC. The notice of default must include:

            calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most
            recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department
            of Treasury as of the due date.

            accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the foreign
            bank&apos;s letter of credit, or any obligation owed by the foreign
            bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to

            exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of CCC
            by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its
            option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus
            accrued interest, in default and make payment to the exporter or the
            exporter&apos;s assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as

             This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of
            the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP). The restrictions and
            criteria set forth at subpart A for the Commodity Credit Corporation
            (CCC) Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102) and the Intermediate
            Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) will apply to this subpart. The
            SCGP was developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by making
            available payment guarantees to encourage U.S. exporters to extend
            financing on credit terms of not more than 180 days to importers of
            U.S. agricultural commodities.

          <text>
             The SCGP operates in cases where credit is necessary to increase or
            maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market and where private U.S.
            exporters would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC&apos;s
            guarantee. The program is operated in a manner intended not to
            interfere with markets for cash sales. The program is targeted
            toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure
            financing of the exports but which have sufficient financial
            strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled
            payments. In providing this credit guarantee facility, CCC seeks to
            expand market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and
            assist long-term

          <text>
             The credit facility created by this program is the SCGP payment
            guarantee (payment guarantee). The payment guarantee is an agreement
            by CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that
            may take assignment of the exporter&apos;s right to proceeds,
            specified amounts of principal and, where applicable, interest due
            from, but not paid by, the importer incurring the obligation in
            connection with the export sale to which CCC&apos;s guarantee
            coverage pertains. By approving an exporter&apos;s application for a
            payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, rather than
            government, financing and incurs a substantial portion of the risk
            of default by the importer. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be

             From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to
            announce a SCGP allocation for a specific country. The Program
            Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific
            allocations for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof,
            will indicate the form of promissory note required by CCC, and will
            provide other pertinent information. Exporters may negotiate export
            sales to importers in that country for one of the commodities
            specified in the Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee
            coverage within the dollar amounts of specified coverage for that
            commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a requirement that
            the exporter&apos;s sales contract contain a shipping deadline
            within the applicable program year. The final date for a contractual
            shipping deadline will be stated in the Program Announcement.
            Program Announcements may also contain a specified “undesignated” or
            “unallocated” dollar amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts
            specified for a specific commodity for a country become fully used,
            an additional allocation from the “unallocated” or “undesignated”
            portion of the total country allocation may then be designated for a
            specific commodity. Program Announcements that include an
            “unallocated” or “undesignated” dollar amount will contain further
            information on the “unallocated” or “undesignated” portion of the
            country allocation.

            tolerance specified in the export sales contract. If such additional

            filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee, and by paying the
            additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the
            payment guarantee is not filed with CCC by the exporter within 30
            days after the date of the last export against the sales contract,
            CCC may determine not to reserve the coverage originally set aside
            for the exporter.

            corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the
            exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee are not viewed as

            must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not
            later than 10 calendar days after the date that payment was due from
            the importer (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted
            in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the
            Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter&apos;s assignee fails
            to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this
            paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with
            respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time

            such extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the
            best interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:

             Recoveries made by CCC from the importer, and recoveries received
            by CCC from the exporter, the exporter&apos;s assignee, or any other
            source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the
            exporter&apos;s assignee and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined
            by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective
            interest of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based
            on the combined amount of principal and interest in default. Once
            CCC has paid out a particular claim under a payment guarantee, CCC
            pro rates any collections it receives and shares these collections
            proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both CCC and
            the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A
