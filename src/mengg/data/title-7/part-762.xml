             Guarantees are available for both a loan note or a line of credit.
            A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and term. A line of
            credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The principal amount
            outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the line of credit
            ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are evidenced by
            the same loan guarantee form.

            may submit the applicant or borrower&apos;s financial information to

            providing financing to the applicant or borrower through the

            application for a guarantee.

             The interest rate on a guaranteed loan or line of credit may be
            fixed or variable as agreed upon between the borrower and the
            lender. The lender may charge different rates on the guaranteed and
            the non-guaranteed portions of the note. The guaranteed portion may
            be fixed while the unguaranteed portion may be variable, or vice
            versa. If both portions are variable, different bases may be used.

             If a variable rate is used, it must be tied to a rate specifically

            lender for its average agricultural loan customer, but the frequency
            of change must be specified in the loan or line of credit
            instrument.

          <text>
             A current appraisal (not more than 12 months old) of primary
            chattel security is generally required on all loans. An appraisal
            for loans or lines of credit for annual production purposes that are
            secured by crops is only required when a guarantee is requested late
            in the current production year and actual yields can be reasonably
            estimated. The appraised value of chattel property will be based on
            public sales of the same, or similar, property in the market area.
            In the absence of such public sales, reputable publications
            reflecting market values may be used. Appraisal reports may be on
            the Agency&apos;s appraisal of chattel property form or on any other
            appraisal form containing at least the same information. Chattel
            appraisals will be performed by appraisers who possess sufficient
            experience or training to establish market (not retail) values as
            determined by the Agency.

             A current real estate appraisal is required when real estate will

            is not current if there have been no significant changes in the
            market or on the subject real estate and the appraisal was either
            completed within the past 12 months or updated by a qualified
            appraisal if not completed within the past 12 months.

             All lenders are required to ensure that due diligence is performed
            in conjunction with a request for guarantee of a loan involving real
            estate. Due diligence is the process of evaluating real estate in
            the context of a real estate transaction to determine the presence
            of contamination from release of hazardous substances, petroleum
            products, or other environmental hazards and determining what
            effect, if any, the contamination has on the security value of the
            property. The Agency will accept as evidence of due diligence the
            most current version of the American Society of Testing Materials
            (ASTM) transaction screen questionnaire available from 100 Barr
            Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, or similar
            documentation, approved for use by the Agency, supplemented as
            necessary by the ASTM phase I environmental site assessments form.

             When a lender receives a payment from the sale of encumbered

            priority. When a payment is received from the sale of unencumbered

            in order of their due date. Agency approval is required for any

             Loans secured by real estate and/or equipment can be restructured
            using a balloon payment, equal installments, or unequal
            installments. Under no circumstances may livestock or crops alone be
            used as security for a loan to be rescheduled using a balloon
            payment. If a balloon payment is used, the projected value of the
            real estate and/or equipment security must indicate that the loan
            will be fully secured when the balloon payment becomes due. The
            projected value will be derived from a current appraisal adjusted
            for depreciation of depreciable property, such as buildings and
            other improvements, that occurs until the balloon payment is due.
            For equipment security, a current appraisal is required. The lender
            is required to project the security value of the equipment at the
            time the balloon payment is due based on the remaining life of the
            equipment, or the depreciation schedule on the borrower&apos;s
            Federal income tax return. Loans restructured with a balloon payment
            that are secured by real estate will have a minimum term of 5 years,
            and other loans will have a minimum term of 3 years before the
            scheduled balloon payment. If statutory limits on terms of loans
            prevent the minimum terms, balloon payments may not be used. If the
            loan is rescheduled with unequal installments, a feasible plan, as
            defined in

             The lender&apos;s security position will not be adversely affected
            because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken
            if needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to
            be restructured, unless it is restructured with a balloon payment.
            When a loan is restructured using a balloon payment the lender must
            take a lien on all assets and project the loan to be fully secured
            at the time the balloon payment becomes due, in accordance with
            paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

             When a lender requests approval of a writedown for a borrower with
            multiple loans, the security for all of the loans will be
            cross-collateralized and continue to serve as security for the loan
            that is written down. If a borrower has multiple loans and one loan
            is written off entirely through debt writedown, the security for
            that loan will not be released and will remain as security for the
            other written down debt. Additional security instruments will be
            taken if required to cross-collateralize security and maintain lien
            priority.

             In the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in cases where the lender
            filed an estimated loss claim, the Agency will pay the lender
            interest that accrues during and up to 45 days after the discharge
            on the portion of the chattel only secured debt that was estimated
            to be secured, but upon final liquidation was found to be unsecured,
            and up to 90 days after the date of discharge on the portion of real
            estate secured debt that was estimated to be secured, but was found
            to be unsecured upon final disposition.
