             A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise agreed
            upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the
            commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by
            CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which
            would otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than
            one outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise,
            prescribe which loan collateral the person shall be required to
            redeem in order to receive payment. The purchase price shall be
            equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan
            for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as
            collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer storage
            loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not
            include the amount of any unearned advance storage payments received
            with respect to the redeemed collateral. After redemption and the
            subsequent sale to CCC of the commodity pledged as collateral for
            such CCC loan, CCC shall make available to the person a like
            quantity of the commodity.

            (including the receipt in accordance with paragraph (e) of this

            such collateral is made): or exchanged for cash, as provided for in

            provisions of this part, and to any terms, conditions and
            restrictions provided on the certificate, which are incorporated by

             Any person may transfer a commodity certificate to any other
            person. However, any such transfer must be in the full amount of the
            certificate, and can be effected only by restrictive endorsement on
            the back of the certificate, showing the name of the transferee and
            the date of the transfer, and signed by the transferor. CCC will not

            other nonrestrictive endorsement, or otherwise transferred in a
