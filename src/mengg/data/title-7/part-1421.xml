             The regulations of this subpart are applicable to the 2008 through
            2012 crops of barley, small chickpeas, corn, grain sorghum, lentils,
            oats, dry peas, peanuts, rice, wheat, wool, mohair, oilseeds and
            other crops designated by Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).
            Additionally, large chickpeas are authorized for coverage for the
            2009 through 2012 crop years. These regulations specify the general
            provisions under which marketing assistance loans (MAL) and loan
            deficiency payments (LDP) will be administered by CCC. Additional
            terms and conditions are in the note and security agreement and the
            loan deficiency payment application that must be executed by a
            producer to receive marketing assistance loans and LDPs. In any case
            in which money must be refunded to CCC in connection with this part,
            interest will be due to run from the date of disbursement of the sum
            to be refunded. This will apply, unless waived by the Deputy
            Administrator, irrespective of any other rule.

             To be eligible to receive marketing assistance loans and loan
            deficiency payments, a producer must have beneficial interest in the
            commodity that is tendered to CCC for a marketing assistance loan or
            is requested for a loan deficiency payment. For the purposes of this
            part, the term “beneficial interest” refers to a determination by
            CCC that a person has title to and control of the commodity that is
            tendered to CCC as collateral for a marketing assistance loan or of
            the commodity that will be used to determine a loan deficiency
            payment.. A determination of whether a person has beneficial
            interest in a commodity is made by CCC in accordance with this part
            and is not based upon a determination under any State law or any
            other regulation of a Federal agency.

             The prevailing world market price for a class of rice will be
            determined by CCC based upon a review of prices at which rice is
            being sold in world markets and a weighting of such prices through
            the use of information such as changes in supply and demand of rice,
            tender offers, credit concessions, barter sales,
            government-to-government sales, special processing costs for
            coatings or premixes, and other relevant price indicators, and will

             When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to repay
            all or a part of a farm-stored loan, the producer must request and
            obtain prior written approval on a CCC-approved form and comply with
            the terms and conditions of such form, to remove a specified
            quantity of the commodity from storage. Approval does not constitute
            release of CCC&apos;s security interest in the commodity or release
            of producer liability for amounts due CCC for the marketing
            assistance loan indebtedness if payment in full is not received by
            the county office. Failure to repay a marketing assistance loan
            within the time period prescribed by CCC in the case of a
            farm-stored loan and delivery of the pledged collateral to a buyer
            is a violation of the agreement. In the case of such violation, the
            producer must repay the loan principal and interest or another
            amount as determined by the Deputy Administrator, FSA, as specified
            in

            still require a warehouse operator that would qualify under
            paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to enter into a storage
            agreement if deemed necessary by the Deputy Administrator to be
            needed to protect CCC&apos;s interests.

             The State committee may establish a marketing assistance loan
            percentage not to exceed a percentage CCC establishes or it may
            apply quality discounts to the loan rate in each year for each
            commodity on a Statewide basis or for specified areas within the
            State. Before approving a county committee request to establish a
            different loan percentage, or to apply quality discounts, the State
            committee shall consider conditions in the State or areas within a
            State to determine if the marketing assistance loan percentage
            should be reduced below the maximum marketing assistance loan
            percentage or the quality discounts should be applied to the basic
            county marketing assistance loan rate to provide CCC with adequate
            protection. Marketing assistance loans disbursed based upon loan
            percentages previously lowered and loan rates adjusted for quality
            shall not be altered if conditions within the State or areas within
            the State 
            <PRTPAGE P='576' />
            change to substantiate removing such reductions. Percentages
            established or loan rates adjusted for quality under this section
            shall apply only to new marketing assistance loans and not to
            outstanding marketing assistance loans. In determining loan
            percentages or the necessity to apply quality discounts, the State
            committee shall consider any factor at its discretion, including the
            following:

            representative of the county office, at the producer&apos;s expense,
            before commingling. Prior to commingling, with respect to wool and

            average production of the wool and mohair in a manner approved by
            CCC.

             Warehouse receipts must be issued in the name of the eligible
            producer or CCC. If issued in the name of the eligible producer, the
            receipt must be properly endorsed on its reverse side certifying
            that the crop is free of encumbrances in order for title to vest in
            the holder. Receipts must be issued by an authorized warehouse and
            must represent a commodity that is deemed to be stored commingled.
            The receipts must be negotiable and must represent a commodity that
            is the same quantity and quality as the eligible commodity actually
            in storage in the warehouse of the original deposit.

             If the receipt is issued for a commodity that is owned by the

            the fact of such 
            <PRTPAGE P='578' />
            ownership shall be stated on the receipt. In States where the pledge

            operator may offer the commodity to CCC for a marketing assistance
            loan if such warehouse is licensed under the U.S. Warehouse Act.

            authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines
            and other program requirements in cases where timeliness or failure

            conditions for payments that will assist in achieving the goals of
            the program and may include such provisions in the program agreement
            or other program documents.

             For the crop to be eligible, the crop, in addition to other
            standards that may apply, must be grown on land that is classified
            as “cropland” in FSA 
            <PRTPAGE P='587' />
            farm records or on land that FSA determines has been cropped in the
            last 3 years except that the land may also qualify if the land is
            committed to a crop rotation, normal for the locality, that includes
            harvesting the subject crop for grain. These rules are designed to
            assure, to the extent practicable, the available payment did not
            produce plantings that otherwise would not have occurred and the CCC
            may deny payments in any instance in which there is reason to
            believe that the planting was done for that purpose. To that end, if
            the commodity involved has not been previously grown by the producer
            or is not one which is not predominately produced locally, the
            producer must submit evidence of seed purchases for planting the
            commodities and other evidence deemed needed or appropriate by the
            COC in order to assure that the program goals are made and that the
            land was not planted to an eligible commodity simply to obtain a
            payment. Also, the land to be eligible must, for the year involved,
            be grazed and cannot, during the crop year, be harvested at any time
            for any purpose, except as determined by the Deputy Administrator to
            accommodate producers with a history of double-cropping when the
            crop to be harvested is not the crop for which a payment is to be
            made under this subpart. Land will be considered grazed only to the
            extent that the crop on the land is consumed in the field as live
            plants by livestock for the normal period of time for grazing in the
            area.

          . The application must describe the land to be grazed and, in
          accordance with standards set by CCC, the tract/field location. The
