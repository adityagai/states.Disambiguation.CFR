             A marketing agreement or a marketing order may be proposed by the
            Secretary or by any other person. If any person other than the
            Secretary proposes a marketing agreement or marketing order, he
            shall file with the Administrator a written application, together
            with at least four copies of the proposal, requesting the Secretary
            to hold a hearing upon the proposal. Upon receipt of such proposal,
            the Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made and such
            consideration thereof to be given as, in his opinion, are warranted.
            If the investigation and consideration lead the Administrator to
            conclude that the proposed marketing agreement or marketing order
            will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, or that
            for other proper reasons a hearing should not be held on the
            proposal, he shall deny the application, and promptly notify the
            applicant of such denial, which notice shall be accompanied by a
            brief statement of the grounds for the denial.

             At the hearing, any interested person shall be given an opportunity
            to appear, either in person or through his authorized counsel or
            representative, and to be heard with respect to matters relevant and
            material to the proceeding. Any interested person who desires to be
            heard in person at any hearing under these rules shall, before
            proceeding to testify, state his name, address, and occupation. If
            any such person is appearing through a counsel or representative,
            such person or such counsel or representative shall, before
            proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing,
            state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or

            person and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such
            counsel or representative shall give such other information
            respecting his appearance as the judge may request.

             Wherever, while a proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds
            that a person, acting as counsel or representative for any person
            participating in the proceeding, is guilty of unethical or
            unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such person be
            precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such
            proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such
            order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending
            disposition of the appeal: 
            <E T='03'>
              Provided,

             That the judge may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for
            the purpose of enabling the client to obtain other counsel or other
            representative. In case the judge has ordered that a person be
            precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in the
            proceeding, the presiding officer, within a reasonable time
            thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and
            circumstances surrounding such order and shall recommend what action
            the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person
            as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the
            Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after notice and an
            opportunity for hearing, issue such order, respecting the appearance
            of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before
            the Secretary, as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.

          The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing as
          soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written
          arguments, briefs, proposed findings and proposed conclusions, and
          shall furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be
          necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall
          transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the
          transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the
          exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. He
          shall attach to the original transcript of testimony his certificate
          stating that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript
          is a true transcript of the testimony given at the hearing except in
          such particulars as he shall specify; and that the exhibits
          transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the hearing with
          such exceptions as he shall specify. A copy of such certificate shall
          be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of testimony. In
          accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall note upon the
          official record copy, and cause to be noted on other copies, of the
          transcript each correction detailed therein by adding or crossing out
          (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) at the
          appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to the
          correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall
          obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections
          have been effected in copies other than the official record copy.

          examiners, legal counsel, hearing venue and associated travel for USDA
          officials. Only the milk pooled in the particular marketing area that
          stands to be affected by proposals heard at the amendatory proceeding
          may be assessed. The assessments shall be subject to the provisions of

          In any proceeding in which it appears that such procedure will
          expedite the proceeding, the judge, at any time prior to the
          commencement of or during the course of the hearing, may request the
          parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before him to
          consider (a) the simplification of issues; (b) the possibility of
          obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents which will avoid
          unnecessary proof; (c) the limitation of the number of expert or other
          witnesses; and (d) such other matters as may expedite and aid in the
          disposition of the proceeding. No transcript of such conference shall
          be made, but the judge shall prepare and file for the record a written
          summary of the action taken at the conference, which shall incorporate
          any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties at the
          conference or as a result of the conference. If the circumstances are
          such that a conference is impracticable, the judge may request the
          parties to correspond with him for the purpose of accomplishing any of
          the objects set forth in this section. The judge shall forward copies
          of letters and documents to the parties as the circumstances require.
          Correspondence in such negotiations shall not be a part of the record,
          but the judge shall submit a written summary for the record if any
          action is taken.

             Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds
            that a person acting as counsel or representative for any party to
            the proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the
            judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting as
            counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the
            Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall
            not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: 
            <E T='03'>
              Provided,

             That the judge may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for
            the purpose of enabling the client to obtain other counsel or
            representative. In case the judge has issued an order precluding a
            person from further acting as counsel or representative in the
            proceeding, the judge, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall
            submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances
            surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend what
            action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such
            person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the
            Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an
            opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance
            of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before
            the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.

            attendance of the witness by subpena but has been unable to do so;

             Subpenas may be served (1) by a United States Marshal or his
            deputy, or (2) by any other person who is not less than 18 years of
            age, or (3) by registering and mailing a copy of the subpena
            addressed to the person to be served at his or its last known
            residence or principal place of business or residence. Proof of
            service may be made by the return of service on the subpena by the
            United States Marshal or his deputy; or, if served by an individual
            other than a United States Marshal or his deputy, by an affidavit of
            such person stating that he personally served a copy of the subpena
            upon the person named therein; or, if service was by registered
            mail, by an affidavit made by the person mailing the subpena that it
            was mailed as provided in this paragraph and by the signed return
            post office receipt: 
            <E T='03'>
              Provided,
            </E>
             That, if the subpena is issued on behalf of the Department, the
            return receipt without an affidavit of mailing shall be sufficient
            proof of service. In making personal service, the person making
            service shall leave a copy of the subpena with the person subpenaed;
            the original, bearing or accompanied by the required proof of
            service, shall be returned to the official who issued the same.

             As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the
            hearing clerk, or, in case oral argument was had, as soon as
            practicable thereafter, the Secretary, upon the basis of and after
            due consideration of the record, shall rule on the appeal. If the
            Secretary decides that no change or modification of the judge&apos;s
            decision is warranted, he may adopt the Judge&apos;s decision as the
            final order of the Secretary, preserving any right of the party
            bringing the appeal to seek judicial review of such decision in the
            proper forum. At no stage of the proceeding between its institution
            and the issuance of the order shall the Secretary discuss ex parte
            the merits of the proceeding with any person who is connected with
            the proceeding in an advocative or an investigative capacity, or
            with any representative of such person:

            parties to the proceeding, or their representatives, have been given

            any party, or from any person acting on behalf of any party, which
            relates to the merits of the proceeding, receives the personal
            attention of the Secretary (or, if an official other than the
            Secretary is to issue the order, then of such other official) during
            the pendency of the proceeding, such memorandum or communication
            shall be regarded as argument made in the proceeding and shall be
            filed with the hearing clerk, who shall serve a copy thereof upon
            the opposite party to file a reply thereto.

            opportunity shall be given the parties to file exceptions thereto
            and written arguments or briefs in support of such exceptions. In
            such case, if exceptions are filed within a period of time (to be
            fixed by the Secretary but not to exceed 20 days) following the
            service of the tentative order, the Secretary shall give

          shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action.

            ballot in each referendum; and no person who may claim to be a

            marked “disqualified” with a notation on the ballot as to the reason
            for the disqualification. The total number of ballots cast,
            including the disqualified ballots, shall be ascertained. The number
            of eligible ballots cast approving and the number of eligible
            ballots cast disapproving the issuance of the order shall also be

          Determinations of qualification for privileges and exemptions are
          subject to amendment, termination or suspension if the association
          does not currently meet the qualification standards. An association
          found to be qualified pursuant to the Act is required to file an
          annual report after its annual meeting has been held following the
          close of its fiscal year. Form DA-24 is used for this purpose. The
          report form is available at the Dairy Division, Agricultural Marketing
          Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. The
          association is required to file a copy of its report with the Dairy
          Division at Washington and with the market administrator of each order
          under which it operates.

             The applicable assessment rate for any handler approved for an

            approved by the Secretary and applying that percentage to the

            The committee&apos;s or board&apos;s estimated non-marketing

            activities. If a committee or board does not plan to conduct any
            market promotion activities in a fiscal year, the committee or board
            may submit a certification to that effect to the Secretary, and as

            promotion projects, or the administration of projects funded by a

            assessment rate applicable to marketing promotion for persons
            eligible for an exemption and, if appropriate, approve the
