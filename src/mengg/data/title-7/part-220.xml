             This section contains the meal requirements applicable to school
            breakfasts for students in grades K to 12. With the exception of the
            milk component, the meal requirements must be implemented beginning
            July 1, 2013 or as otherwise specified. School food authorities
            wishing to adopt the provisions of this section prior to the
            required date of compliance may do so with the approval of the State
            agency. In general, school food authorities must ensure that
            participating schools provide nutritious, well-balanced, and
            age-appropriate breakfasts to all the children they serve to improve
            their diet and safeguard their health.

            Schools must follow a food-based menu planning approach and produce

            pattern established in paragraph (c) of this section for each
            age/grade group served in the school. In addition, school breakfasts
            must meet the dietary specifications in paragraph (f) of this
            section. Schools offering breakfasts to children ages 1 to 4 and
            infants must meet the meal pattern requirements in paragraph (o) of

            beginning of the serving line(s), the food items that constitute the
            unit-priced reimbursable school meal(s).

            criteria specified in FNS guidance. Beginning July 1, 2014 (SY
            2014-2015), all grains must meet the whole grain-rich criteria
            specified in FNS guidance. The whole grain-rich criteria provided in
            FNS guidance may be updated to reflect additional information
            provided voluntarily by industry on the food label or a whole grains
            definition by the Food and Drug Administration. Schools serving
            breakfast 6 or 7 days per week must increase the weekly grains
            quantity by approximately 20 percent (
            <FR>
              1/5
            </FR>
            ) for each additional day. When schools operate less than 5 days per
            week, they may decrease the weekly quantity by approximately 20
            percent (
            <FR>
              1/5
            </FR>
            ) for each day less than five. The servings for biscuits, rolls,
            muffins, and other grain/bread varieties are specified in FNS
            guidance.

            students in age group 1-2 fluid milk in a variety of fat contents,
            flavored or unflavored. Schools may also offer this age group
            lactose-free or reduced-lactose fluid milk. For students in age
            group 3-4, schools must offer fat-free milk (unflavored or flavored)
            and low-fat milk (unflavored only). Schools may also offer this age
            group lactose-free and reduced-lactose milk that is fat-free or
            low-fat. Students in age group 3-4 must be offered a variety (at
            least two different options) of fluid milk. All milk served in the
            Program must be pasteurized fluid milk which meets State and local
            standards for such milk. All fluid milk must have vitamins A and D
            at levels specified by the Food and Drug Administration and must be

            consistency that are appropriate for the age of the infant being
            served. The foods must be served during a span of time consistent

            dietary needs are more individualized, exceptions to the meal
            pattern must be made in accordance with the requirements found in

             Either breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula, or portions of

            breastmilk and meals containing iron-fortified infant formula
            supplied by the school are eligible for reimbursement. However,
            infant formula provided by a parent (or guardian) and breastmilk fed
            directly by the infant&apos;s mother, during a visit to the school,
            contribute to a reimbursable breakfast only when the school supplies
            at least one component of the infant&apos;s meal.

             For infants ages 4 through 7 months, solid foods of an appropriate
            texture and consistency are required only when the infant is
            developmentally ready to accept them. The school should consult with
            the infant&apos;s parent (or guardian) in making the decision to
            introduce solid foods. Solid foods should be introduced one at a
            time, on a gradual basis, with the intent of ensuring the
            infant&apos;s health and nutritional well-being.

             Infant breakfasts must have, at a minimum, each of the food
            components indicated, in the amount that is appropriate for the
            infant&apos;s age. For some breastfed infants who regularly consume
            less than the minimum amount of breastmilk per feeding, a serving of
            less than the minimum amount of breastmilk may be offered. In these
            situations, additional breastmilk must be offered if the infant is
            still hungry. Breakfasts may include portions of breastmilk and
            iron-fortified infant formula as long as the total number of ounces
            meets, or exceeds, the minimum amount required of this food
            component. Similarly, to meet the component requirement for
            vegetables and fruit, portions of both may be served.

             Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the State
            agency, or FNSRO where applicable, may advance funds available for
            the School Breakfast Program to a School Food Authority in an amount
            equal to the reimbursement estimated for the total number of
            breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfasts, to be
            served to children for 1 month. The 
            <PRTPAGE P='110' />
            State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall require School Food
            Authorities who receive advances of funds under the provisions of
            this paragraph to make timely submissions of claims for
            reimbursement on a monthly basis and shall suspend advances of funds
            in the absence of such timely submissions. Following the receipt of
            claims the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall make such
            adjustments as are necessary in such advances of funds to insure
            that the total amount of reimbursement received by a School Food
            Authority for the fiscal year will not exceed an amount equal to the
            number of breakfasts, including free and reduced price breakfast,
            served to children times the respective rates of reimbursement
            assigned by the State agency, or FNSRO where applicable, in

             In conducting management evaluations, reviews, or audits in a
            fiscal year, the State agency, FNS, or OIG may disregard an
            overpayment if the overpayment does not exceed $600. A State agency
            may establish, through State law, regulation or procedure, an
            alternate disregard threshold that does not exceed $600. This
            disregard may be made once per each management evaluation, review,
            or audit per Program within a fiscal year. However, no overpayment
            is to be disregarded where there is substantial evidence of
            violations of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.

             Schools must keep production and menu records for the breakfasts
            they produce. These records must show how the breakfasts contribute
            to the required food components, food items or menu items every day.
            In addition, these records must show how the breakfasts contribute
            to the nutrition standards in paragraph (a) of this section and the
            appropriate calorie and nutrient levels (see paragraphs (c), (d), or
            (h) of this section, depending on the menu planning approach used)
            over the school week. If applicable, schools or school food
            authorities must maintain nutritional analysis records to
            demonstrate that breakfasts, when averaged over each school week,
            meet:

             Once schools know the results of the nutrient analysis based on the
            procedures in paragraphs (e)(5) and (6) of this section, they must
            adjust future menu cycles to reflect production and how often the
            menu items and foods are offered. Schools may need to reanalyze
            menus when the students&apos; selections and, consequently,
            production levels change. Schools may need to change the menu items
            and foods offered given the students&apos; selections and may need
            to modify the recipes and other specifications to make sure that the
            nutrition standards in paragraph (a) and either paragraph (b) or
            (e)(1) of this section are met.

             If a school follows the nutrient standard menu planning approach,
            it must develop and follow standardized recipes. A standardized
            recipe is a recipe that was tested to provide an established yield
            and quantity using the same ingredients for both measurement and
            preparation methods. Any standardized recipes developed by USDA/FNS
            are in the Child Nutrition Database. If a school has its own
            recipes, they must be standardized and analyzed to determine the
            levels of calories, nutrients, and dietary components listed in
            paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. Schools must add any local
            recipes to their local database as outlined in FNS guidance.

            weeks before the planned menu is served, the school must reanalyze
            the revised menu. If the substitution(s) occurs two weeks or less

            reanalysis. However, schools should always try to substitute similar
            foods.

             Alternate menu planning approaches are those adopted or developed
            by school food authorities or State agencies that differ from the
            standard approaches established in paragraphs (e) through (g) of
            this section.

             Within the guidelines established for developing alternate menu
            planning approaches, school food authorities or State agencies may
            modify one of the established menu planning approaches in paragraphs
            (e) through (g) of this section or may develop their own menu
            planning approach. The alternate menu planning approach must be
            available in writing for review and monitoring purposes. No formal
            plan is required; guidance material, a handbook or protocol is
            sufficient. As appropriate, the material must address how the
            guidelines in paragraph (h)(3) of this section are met. A State
            agency that develops an alternate approach that is exempt from FNS
            approval under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section must notify FNS
            in writing when implementing the alternate approach.

             FNS encourages schools to offer children a selection of foods and

            consumption. Schools may offer choices of reimbursable breakfasts or
            foods within a reimbursable breakfast. When a school offers a
            selection of more than one type of breakfast or when it offers a
            variety 
            <PRTPAGE P='129' />
            of food components, menu items or foods and milk for choice as a
            reimbursable breakfast, the school must offer all children the same
            selection(s) regardless of whether the child is eligible for free or
            reduced price breakfasts or must pay the designated full price. The
            school may establish different unit prices for each type of
            breakfast offered provided that the benefits made available to
            children eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts are not
            affected.

             To the extent that school food authorities identify foods in a
            menu, or on the serving line or through other available means of
            communicating with program participants, school food authorities
            must identify products or dishes containing more than 30 parts fully
            hydrated alternate protein products (as specified in appendix A of
            this part) to less than 70 parts beef, pork, poultry or seafood on
            an uncooked basis, in a manner which does not characterize the
            product or dish solely as beef, pork, poultry or seafood.
            Additionally, FNS encourages schools to inform the students,
            parents, and the public about efforts they are making to meet the
            nutrition standards (see paragraph (a) of this section) for school
            breakfasts.
