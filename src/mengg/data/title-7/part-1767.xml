            limit the emissions of certain airborne pollutants by various

            resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to

            liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being
            hedged.

             An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal
            obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived
            asset that 
            <PRTPAGE P='22' />
            a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or
            enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by
            legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory
            estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized
            when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives
            rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the
            liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at
            the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in
            which the obligation is incurred.

             When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently
            of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of
            replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate
            for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial
            betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property
            affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of
            greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the
            estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment
            shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.

            A. This account shall be credited with all investment tax credits

            accounting, partial or full, rather than recognizing, in the income
            statement, the total benefits of the tax credit as realized. After
            such election, a company may not transfer amounts from this account,
            except as authorized herein and in Account 411.4, Investment Tax
            Credit Adjustments, Utility Operations; Account 411.5, Investment
            Tax Credit Adjustments, Nonutility Operations; and Account 420,
            Investment Tax Credits, or with approval of RUS.
          </P>
          <P>
            B. Where the company&apos;s accounting provides that investment tax
            credits are to be passed on to customers, this account shall be
            debited and Account 411.4 credited with a proportionate amount
            determined in relation to the average useful life of electric

            period of time as allowed 
            <PRTPAGE P='64' />
            by a regulatory agency having rate jurisdiction. If, however, the
            deferral procedure provides that investment tax credits are not to
            be passed on to customers, the proportionate restorations to income
            shall be credited to Account 420.

            assigned directly to the utility department the operation of which
            gave rise to the tax, in so far as practicable. Where the tax is not
            attributable to a specific utility department, it shall be
            distributed among the utility departments or nonutility operations
            on an equitable basis after appropriate study to determine such

          Accounting methods and procedures required of all RUS borrowers.

        <P>
          All RUS borrowers shall maintain and keep their books of accounts and
          all other books and records which support the entries in such books of
          accounts in accordance with the accounting principles prescribed in
          this section. Interpretations Nos. 133, 134, 137, 403, 404, 602, 606,
          618, 627, 628, and 629 adopt and implement the provisions of standards
          issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Each
          interpretation includes a synopsis of the requirements of the standard
          as well as specific accounting requirements and interpretations
          required by RUS. The synopsis provides general information to assist
          borrowers in determining whether the standard applies to an individual
          cooperative&apos;s operations. The synopsis is not intended to change
          the requirements of the FASB standards unless it is set forth in the
          section entitled RUS Accounting Requirements in each interpretation.
          If a particular borrower believes a conflict exists between the FASB
          standard and an RUS interpretation, the borrower shall contact the
          Director, PASD, to seek resolution of the issue.

          <P>
            When a minor item of property is removed from service and not
            replaced, a retirement work order is not required except in the case
            of a conductor. The cost of the minor item shall remain in the
            appropriate plant account until the retirement unit, of which it is
            a part, is retired. However, as conductor is recorded in feet and is
            not part of any specific retirement unit, conductor shall be retired
            even though the amount taken down and not replaced is less than a
            retirement unit (two spans).
          </P>
          <P>
            When minor items of plant are removed and not replaced, material
            salvaged shall be recorded on a material salvage ticket. Items of
            material recorded on this ticket shall be charged to the materials
            and supplies account and credited in the miscellaneous columns of
            the Materials Register to the Accumulated Provision for
            Depreciation. In this example, it is assumed that the cost of
            removal is nil. If, however, costs are incurred during the removal
            of minor items of plant, these costs shall reduce the credit to the
            Accumulated Provision for Depreciation.

            When a staking sheet supporting a single work order reflects a
            combination of new construction and replacements, or system
            improvements, the predominant cost shall be the governing factor in
            determining the amount of cost RUS will finance. To illustrate,
            assume that a service is to be run to a new home near the end of an
            existing line. On inspection, the pole from which the service is to
            be run is found to be in very poor physical condition and must be
            replaced. In addition, a single span of wire and a service are
            presently connected to this pole which serve no purpose. The home
            originally served has been demolished and the existing span, pole,
            and service were retired. In other 
            <PRTPAGE P='150' />
            words, what started out to be simply the installation of a new
            service now includes the retirement of a span of wire, a pole, and a
            service; the replacement of a pole; and the running of a new
            service. Assuming the replacement of the pole is the costliest part
            of this project, the construction and retirement activity shall be
            classified as an ordinary replacement even though the work includes
            new construction and retirements without replacement.

          <P>
            If it is necessary to move a conductor from one location to another
            on a pole assembly during the conversion of a line from one phase to

            103Sacrificial Anodes and the Replacement of a Neutral
          </HD>
          <P>
            Many utilities conduct studies to determine whether sacrificial
            anodes are needed to protect underground cable against corrosion.
            The following procedures shall be followed to account for
            sacrificial anodes and the replacement of a neutral:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. If the study results in the installation of sacrificial anodes,
            the cost of the study shall be capitalized to Account 367,
            Underground Conductors and Devices. If the study does not result in
            the installation of anodes, the cost shall be charged to Account
            594, Maintenance of Underground Lines.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. Costs incurred in the first installation are capitalizable even
            though anodes are considered minor items of property. However, only
            the first costs of installation shall be capitalized. All subsequent
            replacements of anodes shall be expensed.
          </P>
          <P>
            3. Sacrificial anodes do not constitute a record unit; therefore,
            the cost of anodes shall be added to the cost of the underground
            cable unit.
          </P>
          <P>
            4. Because a neutral is part of an underground cable record unit,
            and is not, in and of itself, a record unit, the cost to replace a
            corroded neutral shall be charged to Account 594, Maintenance of
            Underground Lines.

            Borrowers are sometimes required to construct terminal facilities in
            the transmission line of another utility in order to receive power
            from their power supplier. The document executed between the
            borrower and the utility is normally referred to as a “License

            of the terminal facilities are to be transferred to, and become the
            property of, the other utility upon completion of the construction.

            1. All construction costs incurred shall be charged to a work order.
            Upon completion of the construction and accumulation of all costs,
            the cost of the facilities that become the property of another
            utility shall be transferred from construction work-in-progress to
            Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant. The cost of the plant
            for which the borrower retains title shall be charged to the
            appropriate plant accounts.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. The cost of the facilities recorded in Account 303 shall be
            amortized to Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant, over
            the contract term or the estimated useful service life of the plant,
            whichever is shorter. If the related contract or contracts for this
            power supply are terminated, the unamortized balance shall be

            An effective load control program should be coordinated with the

            systems. The G&amp;T monitors the power load of the total member
            distribution system to predict the time of the system&apos;s peak
            load. An optimal load control strategy is developed by the G&amp;T
            and is passed on from the G&amp;T computer system to the load

            control program. The equipment used may vary from one integrated
            power system to another. The selection of equipment used is
            determined by the information needs of the integrated power system,
            and the method selected to operate the load control system.

            Some equipment performs only SCADA-type functions. This equipment is
            included with the equipment that performs only load control
            functions because SCADA-type equipment is an integral part of a load
            control program. An effective load control strategy requires current
            information on loads so that member distribution systems can
            determine the actual loads to be shed and the duration of the load
            control.

            irrigation pump. The amount of time that an appliance will be turned
            off by the load control receiver is preset. When the member system
            computer determines that load shedding is necessary, it sends a
            signal to the communication link which then sends signals directly
            to the Load Control Receivers. In a power line based system, the

            line to the Substation Injection Units, which then signals the Load
            Control Receivers to shut down the appliances for the present time.
            In nonpower line based systems, the signal from the communications

            122Retrofitting Demand Meters
          </HD>
          <P>
            A demand meter measures the amount of electricity used over a period
            of time in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and indicates the maximum kilowatts
            (kW) required at any one time by means of a pointer.
          </P>
          <P>
            Electronic or solid state demand meters have a direct readout which
            reads kilowatt demand to two decimal places. The use of a direct
            readout demand meter may result in increased revenues as pointer
            readings tend to register lower than actual usages.
          </P>
          <P>
            The process of retrofitting a demand meter replaces the pointer with
            a direct readout. The cost of such a replacement is usually expensed
            as a minor item of property; however, since the use of a direct
            readout results in a substantial betterment, the excess cost of the
            replacement over the estimated cost, at current prices, of replacing
            the pointer without the betterment is capitalized.

            When minor items of property are added separately from complete
            retirement units, the costs of these items shall be included in work
            orders, and by unitizing all costs of completed construction for a
            month, these minor items shall be spread to the retirement units of
            which they normally form a part. For example, to convert a two-phase
            line to a three-phase line requires the addition of a conductor, an
            insulator and a pole-top pin. A pole-top pin is typically
            capitalized as a component of the cost of the pole to which it is
            attached. Assuming this is the only work order for the month, the
            cost of this pin shall be charged to the conductor, so that its cost
            is included in the total cost of the project. In actual practice,
            however, this does not happen as it is normal to have a number of
            work orders for a given month, which include the setting of poles.
            In allocating the cost of all construction projects for the month,
            part of the cost of pole-top pins shall be allocated to poles even
            though the work orders on which they were capitalized did not

            Disallowances of Costs of Recently Completed Plant

          <P>
            When it becomes probable that a portion of the cost of recently
            completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a
            reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made,
            the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted
            from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. If a
            portion of the costs is explicitly, but indirectly disallowed, the
            equivalent amount of the cost shall be deducted from the reported
            cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. The specific accounts

            1. Estimated disallowed plant costs which the borrower records as a

            134Utility Plant Phase-in Plans
          </HD>
          <P>
            In August 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 92, Regulated
            Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans (Statement No. 92). This
            section provides an overview of the requirements outlined in
            Statement No. 92.
          </P>
          <P>
            The term phase-in plan is used to refer to any method of recognition
            of allowable costs in rates that meets all of the following
            criteria: 
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The method was adopted by the regulator in connection with a
            major, newly completed plant of the regulated enterprise or one of
            its suppliers or a major plant scheduled for completion in the near
            future.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs
            beyond the period in which those allowable costs would be charged to
            expense under generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
            enterprises in general.
          </P>
          <P>
            3. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs
            beyond the period in which those rates would have been ordered under
            the rate-making methods routinely used prior to 1982 by that
            regulator for similar allowable costs of that regulated enterprise. 
          </P>
          <P>
            If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a
            plant on which no substantial physical construction had been
            performed before January 1, 1988, none of the allowable costs that
            are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan for
            rate-making purposes, shall be capitalized for general-purpose
            financial reporting purposes (financial reporting).
          </P>
          <P>
            If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a
            plant completed before January 1, 1988, or a plant on which
            substantial physical construction had been performed before January
            1, 1988, the criteria specified below shall be applied to that plan.
            If the phase-in plan meets all of those criteria, all allowable
            costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under
            the plan shall be capitalized for financial reporting purposes as a
            separate asset (a deferred charge). If any one of those criteria is
            not met, none of the allowable costs that are deferred for future
            recovery by the regulator under the plan shall be capitalized for
            financial reporting. The criteria for determining whether
            capitalization is appropriate are: 
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The allowable costs in question are deferred pursuant to a formal
            plan that has been agreed to by the regulator;
          </P>
          <P>
            2. The plan specifies the timing of recovery of all allowable costs
            that will be deferred under the plan;
          </P>
          <P>
            3. All allowable costs deferred under the plan are scheduled for
            recovery within 10 years of the date when the deferral began; and
          </P>
          <P>
            4. The percentage increase in rates scheduled under the plan for
            each future year is no greater than the percentage increase in rates
            scheduled under the plan for each immediately preceding year. That
            is, the scheduled percentage increase in year two is no greater than
            the percentage increase granted in year one, the scheduled
            percentage increase in year three is no greater than the percentage
            increase in year two, etc. 
          </P>
          <P>
            By definition, a phase-in plan approved prior to 1982 that contains
            provisions contrary to those detailed above is not subject to the
            provisions of Statement No. 92. This exemption, however, only
            relates to a specific utility and a specific regulator. For example,
            a utility cannot use a phase-in plan 
            <PRTPAGE P='161' />
            approved by its regulator for a different utility as justification
            for its phase-in plan exceeding the 10-year limit imposed by
            Statement No. 92.
          </P>
          <P>
            A phase-in plan is a method of rate making intended to moderate a
            sudden increase in rates while providing the regulated enterprise
            with recovery of its investment and a return on that investment
            during the recovery period. A disallowance is a rate-making action
            that prevents the regulated enterprise from recovering either some
            amount of its investment or some amount of return on its investment.
            Statement No. 90 specifies the accounting for disallowances of plant
            costs (see item 133 of this regulation). If a method of rate making
            that meets the criteria for a phase-in plan includes an indirect
            disallowance of plant costs, that disallowance shall be accounted
            for in accordance with Statement No. 90. Cumulative amounts
            capitalized under phase-in plans shall be reported as a separate
            asset in the balance sheet. The net amount capitalized in each
            period or the net amount of previously capitalized allowable costs
            recovered during each period shall be reported as a separate item of
            other income or expense in the income statement. Allowable costs
            capitalized shall not be reported as reductions of other expenses.
          </P>
          <P>
            The terms of any phase-in plan in effect during the year or ordered
            for future years shall be disclosed in the financial statements.
            Statement No. 92 does not permit capitalization for financial
            reporting of allowable costs deferred for future recovery by the
            regulator pursuant to a phase-in plan that does not meet the
            criteria or a phase-in plan related to plant on which substantial
            physical construction was not completed before January 1, 1988.
            Nevertheless, the financial statements shall include disclosures of
            the net amount deferred at the balance sheet date for rate-making
            purposes, and the net change in deferrals for rate-making purposes
            during the year for those plans.
          </P>
          <P>
            If the provisions of Statement No. 92 are applied retroactively, the
            financial statements of all periods presented shall be restated. In
            addition, the restated financial statements shall, in the year that
            Statement No. 92 is first applied, disclose the nature of any
            restatement and its effect on margins before extraordinary items,
            net margins, and on patronage capital at the beginning of the
            earliest period presented. If the financial statements for prior
            years are not restated, the effects of applying Statement No. 92 to
            existing phase-in plans shall be reported as a change in accounting
            principle and the financial statements shall disclose the effect of
            adopting Statement No. 92 on margins before extraordinary items and
            net margins.
          </P>
          <P>
            The application of Statement No. 92 to an existing phase-in plan
            shall be delayed if both of the following conditions are met: 
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The enterprise has filed a rate application to have the plan
            amended to meet the criteria of Statement No. 92 or intends to do so
            as soon as practicable; and
          </P>
          <P>
            2. It is reasonably possible that the regulator will change the
            terms of the phase-in plan so that it will meet the criteria of
            Statement No. 92. 
          </P>
          <P>
            If the above conditions are met, the provisions of Statement No. 92
            shall be applied to the existing phase-in plan on the earlier of the
            date when one of the conditions ceases to be met or the date when
            the final rate order is received, amending or refusing to amend the
            phase-in plan. However, if the enterprise delays filing its
            application for the amendment or the regulator does not process the
            application in the normal period of time, the application of
            Statement No. 92 shall not be further delayed.
          </P>
          <P>
            In applying the criteria of Statement No. 92 to a plan that was in
            existence prior to the first fiscal year beginning after December
            15, 1987, and that was revised to meet that criteria, the 10-year
            criterion and the requirement concerning the percentage increase
            shall be measured from the date of the amendment rather than from
            the date of the first scheduled deferrals under the original plan.
            All phase-in plans must receive RUS approval prior to
            implementation.

          </HD>
          <P>
            As a result of recent hurricane, flood, and ice storm damage, the
            Rural Utilities Service (RUS) has received several inquiries
            concerning the proper accounting for storm damage costs and the
            associated funds received from the Federal Emergency Management
            Administration (FEMA).
          </P>
          <P>
            Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order
            procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise removed from
            service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of
            property installed must be shown on construction work orders. To
            ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is
            as accurate as possible, an effort should be made to accurately
            accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme
            care has been exercised, however, it may still be necessary to use
            estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures.
          </P>
          <P>
            When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement
            loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the accumulated
            provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above
            construction and retirement costs represent maintenance expense.
            Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines,
            straightening poles, and replacing minor items of property. When
            extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to
            an operating condition without delay usually results in excessive
            costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a
            guide in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be
            noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are used, all
            excess costs are charged to maintenance expense.
          </P>
          <P>
            Because of the storm&apos;s destruction, property is retired
            prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses occur.
            When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the
            year in which the losses are incurred. If the recording of such
            losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may
            be charged to Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may
            be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions
            of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting
            for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71),
            are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may
            defer certain costs, provided such costs are included in the
            utility&apos;s rate base and recovered through future rates. If an
            RUS borrower elects to apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, RUS
            approval is required. To obtain RUS approval, a borrower must
            submit:
          </P>
          <P>
            a. A detailed description of the plan including the nature of the
            expense item, the amount of the deferral, the specific time period
            for rate recovery, and justifying support for the time period
            selected;
          </P>
          <P>

          <P>
            c. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the

            To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal

          <P>
            Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the

            100 percent of the cost estimates, and does not specify offset
            expenses, thereby providing the borrower with the maximum
            opportunity to utilize Rural Development Utilities Program loan
            funds to finance capitalizable costs. When 
            <PRTPAGE P='163' />
            the funds are received, they should be accounted for by first
            applying the funds received as a credit to maintenance expense and

            applied as a credit to construction and retirement costs.

              Extraordinary Deductions, may be used when the loss will
              materially distort the income statement. Account 182.1,
              Extraordinary Property Losses, should be used when such costs are
              being deferred under the provisions of Statement No. 71. Costs
              recorded in this account should be amortized to Account 407,
              Amortization of Property Losses, as the costs are recovered
              through rates.

            137 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

          <P>
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for
            the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
            Disposed of (Statement No. 121), requires reporting entities to
            review all long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
            that are to be held, used, or disposed of by that entity for
            impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate
            that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the
            sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
            interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the asset, the
            entity must recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss is
            measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
            exceeds the fair value of the asset. The impairment loss is reported
            as a component of income from continuing operations before income
            taxes for entities presenting an income statement and in the
            statement of activities of not-for-profit organizations. Statement
            No. 121 does not apply to assets included in the scope of Statement
            of Financial Accounting Standards No. 90, Regulated
            Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant
            Costs.

            Entities are required to review long-lived assets and certain
            identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances
            indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be

          </P>
          <P>
            4. A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
            climate that could affect the value of an asset;
          </P>
          <P>
            5. An adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
          </P>
          <P>
            6. An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
            originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; and
          </P>
          <P>
            7. A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a
            history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast
            that demonstrates continued losses associated with an asset used for
            the purpose of producing revenue.
          </P>
          <P>
            The impairment of the asset is measured by estimating the future
            cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
            disposition. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there
            are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
            flows of other groups of assets. Future cash flows are those cash
            inflows that are expected to be generated by the asset less the cash
            outflows expected to be necessary to maintain those inflows. If the
            future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are
            less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss must
            be recognized. If the expected future cash flows are greater than
            the carrying value of the asset, no impairment loss exists.
          </P>
          <P>
            The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount
            (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) of the asset
            exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is
            the amount for which the asset could be bought or sold in an
            arms-length transaction between willing parties. A quoted market
            price is the best evidence of fair value. If this information is not
            available, the fair value should be based upon the best information
            available. Consideration should be given to the price of similar
            assets and valuation techniques such as the present value of the
            expected future cash flows discounted at a rate representative of
            the risk involved, option-pricing models, matrix pricing,
            option-adjusted spread models, and fundamental analysis. All
            available information should be considered when using the above
            pricing techniques.
          </P>
          <P>
            If an impairment is recognized, the carrying value of the asset is
            reduced to the lower of its fair value or its carrying value and, if
            depreciable, depreciated over the remaining useful life. Previously
            recognized impairment losses cannot be restored. If the asset was
            acquired in a business combination and there is goodwill resulting
            from the transaction, the goodwill is included in the asset grouping
            and reduced or eliminated before any adjustment is made to the
            carrying value of the asset.

            Statement No. 121 also applies to all long-lived assets and certain
            identifiable intangibles for which management, having the authority
            to approve the action, has committed to a plan of disposal except
            those assets covered by APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of
            Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
            Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
            Events and Transactions. An asset to be disposed of is carried at
            the lower of its carrying amount (acquisition cost less accumulated
            depreciation) or its fair value less cost to sell.
          </P>
          <P>
            The fair value of the asset to be disposed of is computed in the
            same manner as that for an asset to be held or used by the entity.
            Selling costs include the incremental direct cost to transact the
            sale—broker commissions, legal fees, title transfer, and other
            closing costs that must be incurred before legal title can be
            transferred. Costs such as insurance, security service, and
            utilities are generally excluded unless these costs are part of a
            contractual agreement that obligates the entity to incur such costs
            in the future. If the asset&apos;s fair value is based upon current
            market price or the current selling price for a similar asset, the
            fair value is considered a current amount and is not discounted. If,
            however, the fair value is based upon discounted expected future
            cash flows and if the sale is to occur beyond one year, the cost to
            sell must also be discounted. Assets covered by this statement are
            not depreciated (amortized) while being held for disposal.
          </P>
          <P>
            Subsequent revisions in estimates of fair value less cost to sell
            are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of the asset to
            be disposed of as long as the carrying amount of the asset does not
            exceed the original carrying amount.

            138Automatic Meter Reading Systems—Turtles
          </HD>
          <P>
            Automatic meter reading systems were developed from technology
            called power line carrier communication systems. One such system,
            developed by Hunt Technologies, Inc., is called by its brand name,
            the Turtle system. In addition to its function as an automated
            reading device, the Turtle can provide outage detection, power
            failure counts, and other potential applications. The current Turtle
            system does not have the capability for applications such as
            collection of load survey or interval data. A Turtle system consists
            of:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. A meter reader mounted (retrofitted) inside the meter;
          </P>
          <P>
            2. A receiver located in each substation; and
          </P>
          <P>
            3. Monitoring and programming equipment (software and personal
            computer) usually located in the headquarters building.
          </P>
          <P>
            The system transmits continuous information one way from the meter
            to a receiver located in the substation. The receiver constantly
            monitors every Turtle meter served by the substation. The substation
            receiver can be sized to monitor up to 3,000 Turtle meter readers at
            the same time. The data is then transmitted to the headquarters
            monitoring equipment via telephone line or an equivalent
            communication system.
          </P>
          <P>
            The technical literature and other information provided by the
            manufacturer indicates that this system can only be used for remote
            meter reading, outage detection, power failure counts, and phase
            identification. At this time, there is no indication that the system
            supports other functions such as home security. Therefore, the
            accounting prescribed for the Turtle meter reading devices and
            support equipment relates only to electric utility operations.

          <P>
            The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation
            system formed from a network of 24 satellites and their ground
            stations. Utilities are using this advanced technology geographic
            data collection system to update and modernize their system maps.
            GPS uses a system of satellites orbiting the earth to establish
            plant locations with pinpoint accuracy. By triangulating from three
            satellites and using radio signals to measure distances and locate
            items, system-wide maps can be created of the utility&apos;s service
            area. A field inventory is then taken of the utility&apos;s plant
            and plotted onto the map. The GPS consists of base station
            equipment, remote station equipment, the GPS program, and mapping
            conversion software.
          </P>
          <P>
            All equipment associated with GPS is dedicated to the mapping
            effort. The base station is installed at a fixed location and ties
            satellite measurements into a solid local reference. The remote
            station is a portable receiver that is taken into the field to
            determine locations and is moved from site to site. The GPS program
            is the application software that operates the station equipment and
            is used by layout technicians to gather information of existing and
            new facilities in the field. The conversion software is used for
            converting the GPS and inventory information gathered in the field
            into a form usable by the mapping program.

          <P>
            The distinction between generalized software and application
            software is important. Generalized software provides operating
            support for individual applications. This would include programs for
            such tasks as making printouts of machine-readable records, sorting
            records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs
            written in a symbolic language into machine-language instructions,
            and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs are
            generally furnished by the manufacturer.

            1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and

            over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware
            (i.e., containing central processor). If the purchase invoice does
            not break out or assign a cost to the “generalized software,” it is
            appropriate to include the full amount in hardware costs. Capitalize
            in a separate subaccount of Account 391, all costs for applications
            software determined to have a service life of over one year.
            Depreciate the cost over the estimated useful service life of the

            In October 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, Consolidation of
            All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (Statement No. 94). For purposes of
            reporting to RUS, Statement No. 94 shall be applied as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. An RUS borrower that is a subsidiary of another entity shall
            prepare and submit to RUS separate financial statements even though
            this financial information is presented in the parent&apos;s
            consolidated statements.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. In those cases in which an RUS borrower has a majority-ownership
            in a subsidiary, the borrower must prepare consolidated financial
            statements in accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 94.
            These consolidated statements must also include supplementary
            schedules presenting a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for each
            majority-owned subsidiary included in the consolidated statements.
          </P>
          <P>
            Although Statement No. 94 requires the consolidation of
            majority-owned subsidiaries, Forms 7 and 12 must be prepared on a
            basis consistent with the equity method of accounting for
            investments. For distribution borrowers, this requires that the
            investment be shown on Form 7 in Part C, Balance Sheet, on line 7,
            Investments in Subsidiary Companies, or line 9, Investments in
            Associated Organizations—Other—General Funds, as appropriate. The
            result of operation is shown in Part A, Statement of Operations, on
            line 23, Income (Loss) from Equity Investments. For generation and
            transmission borrowers, the investments should be shown on Form 12,
            in Section C, Balance Sheet, on Line 7, Investments in Subsidiary
            Companies, or Line 9, Investments in Associated

            If a capital credit check is returned due to an inability to locate

            If the records show that a number of former patrons have moved and

            general retirement, however, appropriate amounts shall be included
            to cover payments due these patrons. The cooperative shall then make
            a reasonable effort to locate these patrons through publication of
            their names in the newsletter or local newspaper. If the patrons are
            not located, the amounts set aside and the credits to their accounts
            shall be handled in a manner similar to those for whom payment

          <P>
            Under the standard bylaw provisions recommended by RUS, it is not
            proper to use capital credits that were assigned to former patrons
            to liquidate their delinquent bills. When the standard bylaws are in
            effect and collection efforts have failed, the balance of an
            uncollectible bill, after application of customers deposits and
            membership fees, shall be charged against the accumulated provision
            for uncollectible accounts. If the patron has capital credits
            assigned to him or her, these remain untouched except for a notation
            to indicate the amount of the unpaid 
            <PRTPAGE P='176' />
            bill. When a general retirement of capital credits is made at some
            future date, amounts which would otherwise be due the patron may be
            applied to satisfy the unpaid bill with the balance refunded to him
            or her.

            These enterprises often make patronage refunds or provide evidence
            that an amount equal to such a refund has been credited to the
            utility as an investment of capital. The refund may be in the form
            of cash in the year following the purchase or it may be deducted
            from the next invoice. The notice of patronage credited to the
            borrower&apos;s account may indicate that such capital may be
            retired at some future date upon certain conditions having been met.

            work-in-progress shall be made on an equitable basis. For example,
            patronage capital allocations received from a cooperative money
            lender are allocated between Account 424 and construction
            work-in-progress based upon the ratio of interest charged to
            construction for that particular lender to total interest expense
            incurred for that lender. Patronage capital allocations received

          </P>
          <P>
            1. The employer&apos;s obligation for payment for future absences is

          </P>
          <P>
            2. The obligation relates to employee rights which vest or
            accumulate. Vested rights are considered those for which the
            employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee
            terminates. Rights which accumulate are those earned but unused
            rights to compensated absences which may be carried forward to one
            or more periods, subsequent to the period in which they are earned.

          </HD>
          <P>
            Some borrowers have group insurance or retirement plans or both for
            their employees. As a general rule the cost of these programs is
            borne partially by the cooperative and partially by its employees.
            The cooperative may pay the full cost in advance and recover the
            employee&apos;s share through payroll deductions. The accounting for
            these transactions is as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The cooperative&apos;s advanced payment of premiums on insurance
            and retirement agreements shall be charged to Account 165,
            Prepayments, for the employers portion, and Account 143, Other
            Accounts Receivable, for the employee&apos;s portion.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. The cost of the employer&apos;s portion of a retirement and group
            insurance program shall be charged to construction and retirement
            activities and the applicable operations, maintenance, and
            administrative expense accounts based upon a specific identification
            with employees&apos; labor costs charged therein or, in the absence
            of specific employee identification, based upon direct labor dollars
            or direct labor hours depending upon which allocation technique

            Defined Benefit Pension Plans
          </HD>
          <P>
            A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that defines an amount of
            pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of one or more
            factors such as age, years of service, or compensation. In a defined
            benefit plan, the employer promises to provide, in addition to
            current wages, retirement income payments in future years after the
            employee retires or terminates service. Generally, the amount of
            benefit to be paid depends upon a number of future events that are
            incorporated into the plan&apos;s benefit formula, after including
            how long the employee and any survivors live, how many years of
            service the employee renders, and the employee&apos;s compensation
            in the years immediately before retirement or termination.
          </P>
          <P>
            Under a defined benefit plan, the determination of pension costs,
            assets, liabilities, and the disclosures in the financial statements
            require many calculations and assumptions to be made. This section
            provides a general overview of the accounting and reporting
            requirements associated with a defined benefit pension plan. Consult
            Statement No. 87 for guidance in making the necessary calculations
            and assumption.
          </P>
          <P>
            The accounting and reporting requirements related to a defined
            benefit pension plan are as follows:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The following components shall be included in the periodic
            recognition of net pension cost by an employer sponsoring a defined
            benefit pension plan:
          </P>
          <P>
            a. The service cost component recognized in a period shall be
            determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by
            the pension plan formula to employee service during that period. The
            measurement of the service cost component requires use of an
            attribution method and assumptions.
          </P>
          <P>
            b. The interest cost component recognized in a period shall be
            determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due
            to the passage of time. Measuring the projected benefit obligation
            as a present value requires accrual of an interest cost at rates
            equal to the assumed discount rates.
          </P>
          <P>
            c. For a funded plan, the actual return on plan assets, if any,
            shall be determined based upon the fair value of plan assets at the
            beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and
            benefit payments.
          </P>
          <P>
            d. Plan amendments (including initiation of a plan) often include
            provisions that grant increased benefits based upon services
            rendered in prior period. Because plan amendments are granted with
            the expectation that the employer will realize economic benefits in
            future period, Statement No. 87 does not 
            <PRTPAGE P='180' />
            require the cost of providing such retroactive benefits (prior
            service cost) to be included in net periodic pension cost entirely
            in the year of the amendment but provides for recognition during the
            future service periods of those employees active at the date of the
            amendment who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.
          </P>
          <P>
            The cost of retroactive benefits (including benefits that are
            granted to retirees) is the increase in the projected benefit
            obligation at the date of the amendment. Except as noted below,
            prior service cost shall be amortized by assigning an equal amount
            to each future period of service of each employee active at the date
            of the amendments who is expected to receive benefits under the
            plan. If all or almost all of the plan&apos;s participants are
            inactive, the cost of retroactive plan amendments affecting benefits
            of inactive participants shall be amortized based upon the remaining
            life expectancy of those participants rather than the remaining
            service period.
          </P>
          <P>
            To reduce the complexity and detail of the computations required,
            consistent use of an alternative amortization approach that more
            rapidly reduces the unrecognized cost of retroactive amendments is
            acceptable. For example, a straight-line amortization of the cost
            over the average remaining service period of employees expected to
            receive benefits under the plan is acceptable. The alternative
            method used shall be disclosed.
          </P>
          <P>
            In some situations, a history of regular plan amendments and other
            evidence may indicate that the period during which the employee
            expects to realize economic benefits from an amendment granting
            retroactive benefits is shorter than the entire remaining service
            period of the active employees. Identification of such situations
            requires an assessment of the individual circumstances and the
            substance of the particular plan situation. In those circumstances,
            the amortization of prior service cost shall be accelerated to
            reflect the more rapid expiration of the employer&apos;s economic
            benefits and to recognize the cost in the periods benefited.
          </P>
          <P>
            A plan amendment can reduce rather than increase the projected
            benefit obligation. Such a reduction shall be used to reduce an
            existing unrecognized prior service cost, and the excess, if any,
            shall be amortized on the same basis as the cost of benefit
            increases.
          </P>
          <P>
            e. Gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the
            projected benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from
            experience different from that assumed and changes in assumptions.
            Gains and losses include amounts that have been realized. Because
            gains and losses may reflect refinements in estimates as well as
            real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one
            period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, the
            recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of

            The expected return on plan assets shall be determined based upon
            the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the
            market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of
            plan assets shall be either fair value or a calculated value that
            recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner
            over not more than 5 years. Different ways of calculating
            market-related value may be used for different classes of assets but
            the manner of determining market-related value shall be applied
            consistently from year to year for each asset class.
          </P>
          <P>
            Asset gains and losses are the differences between the actual return
            on assets during a period and the expected return on assets for that
            period. Assets gains and losses include both changes reflected in
            the market-related value of assets and changes not yet reflected in
            the market-related value (that is, the difference between the fair
            value of assets and the market-related value). Asset gains and
            losses not yet reflected in market-related values are not required
            to be amortized.
          </P>
          <P>
            As a minimum, amortization of an unrecognized gain or loss
            (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in
            market-related value) shall be included as a component of net
            pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that
            unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of
            the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
            assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization shall
            be that excess divided by the average remaining service period of
            active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all
            or almost all of a plan&apos;s participants are inactive, the
            average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants shall
            be used instead of average remaining service life.
          </P>
          <P>
            Any systematic method of amortization of gains and losses may be
            used in lieu of the minimum specified in the previous paragraph
            provided that the minimum is used in any period in which the minimum
            is greater (i.e., reduces the net balance by more), the method is
            applied consistently, the method is applied similarly to both gains
            and losses, and the method is disclosed.
          </P>
          <P>
            The gain or loss component of net periodic pension cost shall
            consist of the difference between the actual return on plan assets
            and the expected return on plan assets and amortization of the
            unrecognized net gain or loss from previous periods.
          </P>
          <P>
            2. A liability (unfunded accrued pension cost) shall be recognized
            if the net periodic pension cost recognized pursuant to Statement
            No. 87 exceeds amounts the employer has contributed to the plan. An
            asset (prepaid pension cost) shall be recognized if the net periodic
            pension cost is less than the 
            <PRTPAGE P='181' />
            amounts the employer has contributed to the plan.
          </P>
          <P>
            If the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan
            assets, the employer shall recognize a liability (including unfunded
            accrued pension cost) that is at least equal to the unfunded
            accumulated benefit obligation. Recognition of an additional minimum
            liability is required if an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation
            exists and an asset has been recognized as a prepaid pension cost,
            the liability already recognized as unfunded accrued pension cost is
            less than the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, or no accrued
            or prepaid pension cost has been recognized.
          </P>
          <P>
            If an additional minimum liability is recognized, an equal amount
            shall be recognized as an intangible asset, provided that the asset
            does not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior service cost. If an
            additional liability required to be recognized exceeds unrecognized
            prior service cost, the excess (which represents a net loss not yet
            recognized as a net periodic pension cost) shall be reported as a
            separate component (reduction) of equity.
          </P>
          <P>
            When a new determination of the amount of additional liability is
            made to prepare a balance sheet, the related intangible asset and
            separate component of equity shall be eliminated or adjusted, as
            necessary.
          </P>
          <P>
            3. An employer sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan shall
            disclose the following information:
          </P>
          <P>
            a. A description of the plan including employee groups covered, type
            of benefit formula, funding policy, types of assets held and
            significant nonbenefit liabilities, if any, and the nature and
            effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information
            for all period presented.
          </P>
          <P>
            b. The amount of net periodic pension cost for the period showing
            separately the service cost component, the interest cost component,
            the actual return on assets for the period, and the net total of
            other components.
          </P>
          <P>
            c. A schedule reconciling the funded status of the plan with amounts
            reported in the employer&apos;s balance sheet, showing separately,
            the fair value of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation
            identifying the accumulated benefit obligation and the vested
            benefit obligation, the amount of unrecognized prior service cost,
            the amount of unrecognized net gain or loss including asset gains
            and losses not yet reflected in market-related value), the amount of
            any remaining unrecognized net obligation or net asset existing at
            the date of initial application of Statement No. 87, the amount of
            any additional liability recognized, and the amount of net pension
            asset or liability recognized in the balance sheet (which is the net
            result of combining the previous six items).
          </P>
          <P>
            d. The weighted-average assumed discount rate and rate of
            compensation increase (if applicable) used to measure the projected
            benefit obligation and the weighted-average expected long-term rate
            of return on plan assets.
          </P>
          <P>
            e. If applicable, the amount and type of securities of the employer
            and related parties included in plan assets, and the approximate
            amount of annual benefits of employees and retirees covered by
            annuity contracts issued by the employer and related parties. Also,
            if applicable, the alternative amortization periods used.
          </P>
          <P>
            f. An employer that sponsors two or more separate defined benefit
            pension plans shall determine net periodic pension cost,
            liabilities, and assets by separately applying the provisions of
            Statement No. 87 to each plan. In particular, unless an employer
            clearly has a right to use the assets of one plan to pay benefits of
            another, a liability required to be recognized for one plan shall
            not be reduced or eliminated because another plan has assets in
            excess of its accumulated benefit obligation or because the employer
            has prepaid pension cost related to another plan.
          </P>
          <P>
            The required disclosures may be aggregated for all of an
            employer&apos;s single-employer defined benefit plans, or plans may
            be disaggregated into groups so as to provide the most useful
            information. Plans with assets in excess of the accumulated benefit
            obligation, however, shall not be aggregated with plans that have
            accumulated benefit obligations that exceed plan assets.

            Annuity Contracts
          </HD>
          <P>
            An annuity contract is a contract in which an insurance company
            unconditionally undertakes a legal obligation to provide specified
            benefits to specific individuals in return for a fixed consideration
            or premium. An annuity contract is irrevocable and involves the
            transfer of significant risk from the employer to the insurance
            company. Some annuity contracts (participating annuity contracts)
            provide that the purchaser (either the plan or the employer) may
            participate in the experience of the insurance company. Under these
            contracts, the insurance company ordinarily pays dividends to the
            purchaser. If the substance of a participating contract is such that
            the employer remains subject to all or most of the risks and rewards
            associated with the benefit obligation covered and the assets
            transferred to the insurance company, that contract is not an
            annuity contract for purposes of Statement No. 87.
          </P>
          <P>
            To the extent that benefits currently earned are covered by annuity
            contracts, the cost of these benefits shall be the cost of
            purchasing the contracts, except as noted below. That is, if all
            benefits attributed by the plan&apos;s benefits formula to service
            in the current period are covered by nonparticipating annuity
            contracts, the cost of the contracts determines the service cost
            component of net pension cost for that period.

            Benefits provided by the pension benefit formula beyond benefits
            provided by annuity contracts (for example, benefits related to
            future compensation levels) shall be accounted for according to the
            provisions applicable to plans not involving insurance contracts.

            Some annuity contracts provide that the purchaser (either the plan
            or the employer) may participate in the experience of the insurance
            company. Under these contracts, the insurance company ordinarily
            pays dividends to the purchaser, the effect of which is to reduce
            the cost of the plan. The purchase price of a participating annuity
            contract ordinarily is higher than the price of an equivalent
            contract without participation rights. The cost of the participation
            right shall be recognized, at the date of purchase, as an asset. In
            subsequent periods, the participation right shall be measured at its
            fair value if the contract is such that the fair value is reasonably
            estimable. Otherwise, the participation right shall be measured at
            its amortized cost (not in excess of its net realizable value), and
            the cost shall be amortized systematically over the expected
            dividend period under the contract.

            Defined Contribution Plans

            A defined contribution pension plan is a plan that provides pension
            benefits in return for services rendered, provides an individual
            account for each participant, and has terms that specify how
            contributions to the individual&apos;s accounts are to be determined
            rather than the amount of pension benefits the individual is to
            receive. Under a defined contribution plan, the pension benefits a
            participant will receive depend only upon the amount contributed to
            the participant&apos;s account, the returns earned on investments of
            those contributions, and forfeitures of other participants&apos;

            unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more
            collective-bargaining agreements. A characteristic of multiemployer
            plans is that assets contributed by one participating employer may
            be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating
            employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated
            in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to
            employees of that employer.

            required contribution includes both current costs and prior service
            costs. If an employer elects to fund prior service cost in full at
            the inception of the plan, the total payment becomes the

            Some vendors from which electric cooperatives purchase plant
            materials and supplies and merchandise for resale are making
            purchase rebates based upon the quantity or dollar volume of
            purchases. These “quantity discounts” may be in the form of cash or
            credit memoranda, in the form of prepaid package travel
            arrangements, or a combination of such methods. The rebate shall be
            accounted for as a reduction in the cost of the material or
            appliances upon which it was based.
          </P>
          <P>
            In some instances, the rebate may be for material or appliances that

            materially distorting the cost of the remaining appliances, if a
            portion of the items upon which the rebate was based are no longer
            in stock, a portion of the credit shall be prorated to Account 416,

            The CFC Integrity Fund was established to assist borrowers in their
            attempts to stop takeover bids by investor-owned utilities. A
            borrower makes a contribution to the Integrity Fund in the form of
            cash or patronage capital refunds. CFC retains the contribution for
            a 5-year period during which time the borrower earns interest on the
            balance in its account. Each year, the borrower receives a statement
            indicating (both for the total fund and the individual
            borrower&apos;s share) the amount contributed, interest earned,
            disbursements made, and the ending balance. The disbursements from
            the fund are allocated to each contributing borrower&apos;s account
            based upon their individual account balances. At the end of the
            5-year period, the balance in the account, if any, is refunded to

            622In-Substance Defeasance
          </HD>
          <P>
            An in-substance defeasance has been defined as the process whereby a
            debtor irrevocably places cash or other assets in a trust to be used
            solely for the purpose of satisfying 
            <PRTPAGE P='187' />
            scheduled payments of both principal and interest related to a
            specific debt obligation. Under the structural arrangements of an
            in-substance defeasance, the probability that the debtor will be
            required to make additional future debt payments is remote. In these
            specific circumstances, debt has been determined to be extinguished
            even though the debtor has not been legally released from his
            obligations under the debt instrument.
          </P>
          <P>
            The trust established in a defeasance transaction is restricted as
            to the nature of the assets held. The trust must be funded with
            monetary assets that are essentially risk free as to the amount,
            timing, and collection of interest and principal. For debt
            denominated in United States dollars, “risk free” assets are limited
            to: 
          </P>
          <P>
            1. Direct obligations of the United States government;
          </P>
          <P>
            2. Obligations guaranteed by the United States government; and
          </P>
          <P>
            3. Securities that are backed by United States government
            obligations as collateral under an arrangement by which the interest
            and principal payments on the collateral, flow immediately through
            to the holder of the security. 
          </P>
          <P>
            The monetary assets of the trust must provide cash flows sufficient
            to coincide with the scheduled interest and principal payments on
            the defeased debt. If the trust is expected to pay the costs
            associated with the defeasance, such as trustee fees, these costs
            must be considered in determining the amount of funds required by
            the trust.
          </P>
          <P>
            The principles of in-substance defeasance apply only to debt with
            specific maturities and fixed payment schedules and, as such, do not
            apply to debt with variable terms in which advance determination of
            debt service requirements is not possible.
          </P>
          <P>
            Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) address the
            extinguishment of debt in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
            26, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 76,
            Extinguishment of Debt. In accordance with these two statements,
            debt which has been defeased remains recorded in the regulated books
            of account as do the assets placed in the irrevocable trust. They
            are not, however, recognized as an asset and liability for financial
            reporting purposes. The transaction, including the total amount of
            debt outstanding and the total amount of debt that is considered
            extinguished at the end of the period, must be disclosed in the
            footnotes to the financial statements as long as the debt remains
            outstanding.
          </P>
          <P>
            Debt is frequently extinguished before its scheduled maturity. Debt
            may be extinguished by the use of the borrower&apos;s general funds,
            or by the reacquisition of another debt issue at a different
            interest rate or varying terms. As these assets are expected to be
            revenue producing during those years, both the assets and the
            revenue they generate may be utilized to meet maturing debt
            payments. Therefore, in most instances, the dollar value of the
            assets initially placed in the trust do not equal the dollar value
            of the outstanding principal balance. The difference represents an
            “economic ” gain or loss to the borrower.
          </P>
          <P>
            To provide consistency in reporting among all RUS borrowers, any
            gain or loss that is recognized for financial statement purposes
            should be reported in accordance with the provisions of General
            Instruction No. 17 of this part. Therefore, the gain or loss should
            be amortized (for reporting purposes) in equal monthly amounts over
            the remaining life of the original debt issue or the remaining life
            of the new issue. The gain or loss may be reported in the current
            period only in those instances in which it is immaterial to the
            financial statements.

          <P>
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers&apos;
            Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions
            (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the
            expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years the
            employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying
            the provisions of Statement No. 106, members of the board of
            directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior
            to the issuance of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities
            accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a “pay-as-you-go”
            basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the
            employee provided service to the entity in exchange for the
            benefits.
          </P>
          <P>
            As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a
            deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to
            exchange future benefits for an employee&apos;s current services.
            Postretirement benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
            Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health
            care, life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services,
            and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan.
          </P>
          <P>
            This statement applies to both written plans and to plans whose
            existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement
            benefits. An employer&apos;s practice of providing postretirement
            benefits to selected employees under individual contracts with
            specified terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does
            not, however, constitute a postretirement benefit plan under the
            provisions of this statement.
          </P>
          <P>
            Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories:
            single-employer defined benefit plans, multi-employer plans, and
            multiple-employer plans.
          </P>
          <P>
            The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus
            on single-and multiple-employer plans. The accounting requirements
            set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined
            contribution plans shall be adopted for borrowers electing those
            types of plans.
          </P>
          <P>
            Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components
            of the postretirement benefit cost: the current period cost and the
            transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time
            accrual of the costs resulting from services already provided.
            Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred
            and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
            service period of the active employees. If the average remaining
            service life of the employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year
            amortization period may be used.

          <P>
            All RUS borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and
            reporting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106. The
            transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be
            based upon an actuarial study. This study must be updated to allow
            the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of
            Statement No. 106; however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated
            every five years. RUS will not allow electric borrowers to account
            for postretirement benefits on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
          </P>
          <P>
            The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation does not
            require RUS approval provided that it complies with the provisions
            of Statement No. 106. If, however, a borrower elects to expense the
            transition obligation in the current period and subsequently defer
            this expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects 
            <PRTPAGE P='191' />
            of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by
            RUS. In those states in which the commission will not allow the
            recovery of the transition obligation through future rates, the
            transition obligation must be expensed, in its entirety, in the year
            in which Statement No. 106 is adopted. A portion of the transition
            obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities
            provided such charges are properly supported.

            Statement No. 106. At the time of the adoption of Statement No. 106,
            rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period
            expense and any amortization of the transition obligation. A copy of
            a board resolution or commission order, as appropriate, indicating
            that the transition obligation and current period expense have been
            included in the borrower&apos;s rates must be submitted to RUS.

            average remaining service period of the active employees or 20 years
            in accordance with Statement No. 106, no entry is required. Instead,
            the transition obligation is recognized as a component of
            postretirement benefit cost as it is amortized. It should be noted,
            however, that the amount of the unamortized transition obligation
            must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

          <P>
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers&apos;
            Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement No. 112)
            establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for
            employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after
            employment but before retirement. Inactive employees are those who
            are not currently rendering service to the employer but who have not
            been terminated, including employees who are on disability leave,
            regardless of whether they are expected to return to active service.
            For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 112, former
            members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of
            the cooperative.
          </P>
          <P>
            Postemployment benefits include benefits provided to former or
            inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents.
            They include, but are not limited to, salary continuation,
            supplemental benefits (including workmen&apos;s compensation),
            health care, job training and counseling, and life insurance
            coverage. Benefits may be provided in cash or in kind and may be
            paid upon cessation of active employment or over a specified period
            of time.
          </P>
          <P>
            The cost of providing postemployment benefits is considered to be a
            part of the compensation provided to an employee in exchange for
            current service and should, therefore, be accrued as the employee
            earns the right to be paid for future postemployment benefits.
            Applying the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standards No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences, a
            postemployment benefit obligation is accrued when all of the
            following conditions are met:
          </P>
          <P>
            1. The employer&apos;s obligation for payment for future absences is
            attributable to employees&apos; services already performed;
          </P>
          <P>
            2. The obligation relates to employee rights that vest or
            accumulate. Vested rights are considered those rights for which the
            employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee
            terminates. Rights that accumulate are those earned, but unused
            rights to compensated absences that may be carried forward to one or
            more periods subsequent to the period in which they are earned;
          </P>
          <P>
            3. Payment of the compensation is probable; and
          </P>
          <P>
            4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
          </P>
          <P>
            If all of these conditions are not met, the employer must account
            for its postemployment benefit obligation in accordance with
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for
            Contingencies (Statement No. 5) when it becomes probable that a
            liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be
            reasonably estimated.
          </P>
          <P>
            If an obligation for postemployment benefits is not accrued in
            accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 5 or Statement No.
            43 only because the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the
            financial statements should disclose that fact.

            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for
            Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No.

            reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments in
            equity securities that have readily determinable fair values.
            Statement No. 115 does not apply to investments in equity securities
            accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in
            consolidated subsidiaries.
          </P>
          <P>
            At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity
            securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity,
            available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the
            appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed.
          </P>
          <P>
            Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity
            and are measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet only if the
            reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these
            securities to maturity. Debt securities are not classified as
            held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security
            only for an indefinite period; for example, if the security would
            become available for sale in response to changes in market interest
            rates and related changes in the security&apos;s prepayment risk,
            needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on
            alternative investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and
            changes in foreign currency risk.
          </P>
          <P>
            Investments in debt securities that are not classified as
            held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily
            determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities
            or available-for-sale securities and are measured at fair value in
            the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are
            bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the
            near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying
            and selling and trading securities are generally used with the
            objective of generating profits on short-term differences in prices.
            Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified
            as either trading securities or held-to-maturity securities.

            current period. The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for
            subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the
            fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the

            in the separate component of equity.

            The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Split Dollar
            Life Insurance provides life insurance benefits to cooperative
            employees. The benefits provided under this policy consist of two
            components, the face value of the insurance policy and the
            accumulated cash surrender value. While the employee is the owner of
            the policy, the employee must sign a collateral assignment giving
            the cooperative absolute right to the cash surrender value of the
            policy. Under the terms of this collateral assignment, the employee
            must reimburse the cooperative for the premiums paid upon the
            employee&apos;s termination of employment or attainment of the age
            of 62 if the employee wishes to maintain the insurance coverage. If
            death occurs prior to either of these events, the premiums paid to
            date by the cooperative are deducted from the death benefits payable
            to the policy beneficiary.

            Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85-4,
            Accounting for Purchase of Life Insurance (Bulletin 85-4), states
            that the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract
            as of the date of the financial statements should be reported as an
            asset. The change in the cash surrender or contract value of that
            asset during the period should be reported as an adjustment to the
            premiums paid in determining the expense or income to be recognized
            for the period. The cooperative shall, therefore, record the cash
            surrender value of the policy as an asset because of its absolute
            right to receive that value based upon the employee&apos;s
            collateral assignment. Any receivable that may occur as a result of
            the employee reimbursement for the premiums paid is contingent upon
            the employee electing to maintain the insurance coverage after
            termination of employment or reaching the age of 62 and is not
            recorded as an asset on the cooperative&apos;s records.

            631Special Early Retirement Plan
          </HD>
          <P>
            The Special Early Retirement Plan (SERP) being offered through the
            National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) constitutes
            an amendment to its Retirement and Security (R&amp;S) program. The
            SERP is often chosen as a vehicle through which the cooperative may
            reduce the size of its workforce or replace more highly paid
            employees with lower paid entry level employees. If an employee
            covered by an NRECA retirement plan chose to retire before his/her
            normal retirement date, that employee would receive an actuarially
            reduced benefit. However, when a cooperative elects to offer a SERP,
            no such reduction is required. The cooperative selects the criteria
            under which an employee will be eligible to participate such as age,
            years of service, or a combination of age and benefit service
            requirements. As with other amendments to the R&amp;S program, NRECA
            calculates the cost of the plan based upon the criteria selected by
            the cooperative and allows the cooperative to pay the cost
            immediately or on an installment basis.
          </P>
          <P>
            Under this plan, the employee receives full retirement benefits in
            the form of either an immediate lump-sum settlement or annuity
            payments. It is not unusual for the cooperative to add an incentive
            to encourage participation such as medical or life insurance, either
            in whole or in part, until age 65. The actuarial analysis provided
            by NRECA includes the cost of the SERP and the estimated reduction
            and/or increase in costs associated with Statement of Financial
            Accounting Standards No. 106, Employer&apos;s Accounting for
            Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (Statement No. 106).

            whether paid immediately or financed through NRECA or any other
            institution, must be recognized as an expense at that time. This

          <P>
            In accordance with Statement No. 106, prior service postretirement
            benefit costs are recognized in equal amounts in each remaining year
            of service for active plan participants. Because it is an
            off-balance sheet item, only a memorandum entry is required to
            reduce the amount of unrecognized prior service cost.

          <P>
            At adoption, Statement No. 106 permitted the recognition of the
            transition obligation in one of two ways. The transition obligation
            was recognized over the longer of the average remaining service
            period of current plan participants or 20 years, or it may have been
            recognized immediately. If the delayed recognition option was chosen
            under Statement No. 106, this, too, was an off-balance sheet item
            that requires only a memorandum entry to reduce the amount of
            unrecognized transition obligation. However, if the immediate
            recognition option was chosen, the cooperative either recorded the
            expense in that year or, with RUS approval, deferred the expense
            under the provisions of Statement No. 71. If the expense were
            recorded, in total, in the year of adoption, no unrecognized
            transition obligation remains to reduce. If, however, the transition
            obligation was deferred in accordance with Statement No. 71, the
            journal entry required to effect the reduction in Statement No. 106
            expense is as follows:

            Cushion of credit is intended to enable the borrower to deposit
            funds and have those funds available to make scheduled payments (or
            installments) only. A borrower may not have more cushion of credit
            funds, including accrued interest, than their entire Rural
            Development debt which includes loans made in Rural Electric and
            Telephone (RET) and Federal Financing Bank (FFB). If a borrower
            makes less than or no payment when their billing invoice is due,
            cushion of credit will automatically add to or make their payment
            systematically for them.

            2. The borrower intends to prepay all remaining debt using a

            Previously, Rural Development required that the balance in the
            cushion of credit account be reported, on the Form 7, Financial and
            Statistical Report, as a reduction of the Rural Development
            long-term debt balance. On January 15, 2003, Rural Development
            issued letter guidance permitting a proportionate share of the
            cushion of credit balance be reported as a reduction in Current
            Maturities Long-Term Debt. Additionally, beginning with calendar
            year 2006 submissions, Form 7 has been revised to include a separate
            line for cushion of credit balances within the long-term debt
            section of Part C.
          </P>
          <P>
            For purposes of the audited financial statements, presentation of
            the balance of the cushion of credit account as a long-term
            investment is an acceptable alternative to Rural Development.
