            proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as
            security for financing construction of new, or improvement of
            existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the
            property was transferred, the Secretary may, upon request of the
            transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon
            such conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, agree to
            forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as
            the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
