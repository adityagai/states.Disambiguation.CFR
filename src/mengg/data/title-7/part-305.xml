             Breaks, damage, etc., in the treatment enclosure that preclude
            maintaining correct temperatures must be repaired before the
            enclosure is used. An official authorized by APHIS must approve
            loading of compartment, number and placement of temperature probes
            or sensors, and initial fruit temperature readings before beginning
            the treatment. Hanging decks and hatch coamings within vessels may
            not be used as enclosures for in-transit cold treatment without
            prior written approval from APHIS. Double-stacking of pallets is not
            allowed.

             Temperature recording devices used during treatment must be secured
            using measures approved by APHIS as adequate to ensure the security
            and integrity of cold treatment data. The devices must be able to
            record the date, time, and sensor number and automatic and
            continuous records of the temperature during all calibrations and
            during treatment. Recording devices must be capable of generating
            temperature charts for verification by an inspector. If records of
            calibrations or treatments are found to have been manipulated, the
            vessel or container in which the treatment is performed may be
            suspended from conducting cold treatments until proper equipment is

            APHIS&apos; decision to recertify a vessel or container will take

             An inspector will sample and cut fruit from each consignment cold
            treated for Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) to monitor treatment
            effectiveness. If a single live Medfly in any stage of development
            is found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is
            completed and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented. If
            APHIS determines at any time that the safeguards contained in this
            section do not appear to be effective against the Medfly, APHIS may
            suspend the importation of fruits from the originating country and
            conduct an investigation into the cause of the deficiency.

             The cold treatments required for the entry of fruit are considered

             Where certified irradiation facilities are available, an approved
            irradiation treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated
            article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the
            United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from
            Hawaii or U.S. territories, irradiation treatment may be conducted
            either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the
            mainland United States. Irradiation facilities may be located in any
            State on the mainland United States. For irradiation facilities
            located in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida,
            Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North
            Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, the

             Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the

            health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the

            Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely

            in the United States.

             Irradiated articles may be imported into the United States in

            which the irradiation facility is located or a private export group
            has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. That agreement
            requires the NPPO or the private export group to pay, in advance of
            each shipping season, all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur
            in providing inspection and treatment monitoring services at the
            irradiation facility during that shipping season. Those costs
            include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime
            and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses
            (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses
            incurred by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement will
            describe the general nature and scope of APHIS services provided at
            irradiation facilities covered by the agreement, such as whether
            APHIS inspectors will monitor operations continuously or
            intermittently, and will generally describe the extent of
            inspections APHIS will perform on articles prior to and after
            irradiation. The agreement requires the NPPO or private export group
            to deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s check with APHIS for the
            amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not
            sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement
            further requires the NPPO or the private export group to deposit
            with APHIS a certified or cashier&apos;s check for the amount of the
            remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before any more articles
            irradiated in that country may be imported into the United States.
            After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any
            overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO or the private
            export group or held on account until needed, at the option of the
            NPPO or the private export group.

            regarding any dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules
            of practice that will be adopted for the proceeding. However, the
            Administrator will suspend certification pending final determination
            in the proceeding if he or she determines that suspension is
            necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous insect. The
            suspension will 
            <PRTPAGE P='181' />
            be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is
            earlier, to the irradiation processor. In the event of oral
            notification, written confirmation will be given to the irradiation
            processor within 10 days of the oral notification. The suspension
            will continue in effect pending completion of the proceeding and any
            judicial review of the proceeding.
