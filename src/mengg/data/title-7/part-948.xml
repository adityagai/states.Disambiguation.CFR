          The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of
          potatoes for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to
          determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and
          regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee
          finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with
          requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in
          special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or
          Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and
          further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and
          not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee
          but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding
          fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied
          may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his
          disqualification.
