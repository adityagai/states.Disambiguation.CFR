            be provided to NIFA in order to assist NIFA in carrying out its
            responsibilities under NEPA. These responsibilities include
            determining whether the project requires an Environmental Assessment
            or an Environmental Impact Statement or whether it can be excluded
            from this requirement on the basis of several categorical exclusions

            for exclusion to ascertain whether the proposed project may fall
            within one or more of the exclusions, and should indicate if it does
            so on the National Environmental Policy Act Exclusions Form (Form
            NIFA—1234) provided in the Application Kit. Even though the
            applicant considers that a proposed project may fall within a
            categorical exclusion, NIFA may determine that an Environmental
            Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for a
            proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental
            grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances
            are present that may cause such activity to have a significant

            make informed judgments in selecting proposals for ultimate support.
            Incomplete, unclear, or poorly organized applications will work to
            the detriment of applicants during the peer evaluation process. To

             This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to
            support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of
            time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at
            a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory,
            appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support
            would be in the best interests of the Federal government and the
            public. It involves a long-term research project that is considered
            by peer reviewers and Departmental officers to have an unusually
            high degree of scientific merit, the results of which are expected
            to have a significant impact on the productivity of the
            Nation&apos;s rangelands, and it supports the efforts of experienced
            scientists with records of outstanding research accomplishments.
            This kind of document normally will be awarded for an initial
            one-year period and any subsequent continuation research project
            grants also will be awarded in one-year increments, but in no case
            may the cumulative period of the project exceed the statutory limit.
            The award of a continuation research project grant to fund an
            initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an
            obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. A grantee must
            submit a separate application for continued support for each
            subsequent fiscal year. Requests for such continued support must be
            submitted in duplicate at least three months prior to the expiration
            date of the budget period currently being funded. Such requests must
            include: an interim progress report detailing all work performed to
            date; an Application for Funding; a proposed budget for the enuring
            period, including an estimate of funds anticipated to remain
            unobligated at the end of the current budget period; and current
            information regarding other extramural support for senior personnel.
            Decisions regarding continued support and the actual funding levels
            of such support in future years usually will be made
            administratively after consideration of such factors as the
            grantee&apos;s progress and management practices and within the
            context of available funds. Since initial peer reviews were based
            upon the full term and scope of the original rangeland research
            application for funding, additional evaluations of this type
            generally are not required prior to successive years&apos; support.
            However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the project or
            key personnel change or when the amount of future support requested
            substantially exceeds the application for funding originally
            reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to
            approval of continued funding.

            period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, but in
            no case may the cumulative period of the project, including short
            term extensions, exceed the statutory time limitation. A supplement
            is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of the
            original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification of
            need to warrant such action. A request of this nature normally does
            not require additional peer review.

             Proposals satisfactorily meeting the guidelines will be evaluated
            and scored by the peer review panel for each criterion utilizing a
            scale of 1 through 10. A score of one (1) will be considered low and
            a score of ten (10) will be considered high for each selection
            criterion. A weighted factor is used for each criterion.
