            any month shall include only milk served in that month except if the
            first or last month of Program operations for any year contains 10
            operating days or less, such month may be added to the Claim for
            Reimbursement for the appropriate adjacent month; however, Claims
            for Reimbursement may not combine operations occurring in two fiscal
            years. If a single State agency administers any combination of the
            Child Nutrition Programs, the SFA shall be able to use a common
            claim form with respect to claims for reimbursement for meals served
            under those programs. A final Claim for Reimbursement shall be
            postmarked and/or submitted to the State agency, or FNSRO where
            applicable, not later than 60 days following the last day of the
            full month covered by the claim. State agencies may establish
            shorter deadlines at their discretion. Claims not postmarked and/or
            submitted within 60 days shall not be paid with Program funds unless
            FNS determines that an exception should be granted. The State
            agency, or FNSRO where applicable, shall promptly take corrective
            action with respect to any Claim for Reimbursement as determined
            necessary through its claim review process or otherwise. In taking
            such corrective action, State agencies may make upward adjustments
            in Program funds claimed on claims filed within the 60 day deadline
            if such adjustments are completed within 90 days of the last day of
            the claim month and are reflected in the final Report of School
            Program Operations (FNS-10) for the claim month which is required

            have to give the information, but if you do not, we cannot approve

            number of the adult household member who signs the application. The
            social security number is not required when you apply on behalf of a

            signing the application does not have a social security number. We

             The State agency may impose a pre-issuance review requirement on a

            procedures, proposed contracts and contract terms. School food

            procurement procedures and solicitation and contract documents to
