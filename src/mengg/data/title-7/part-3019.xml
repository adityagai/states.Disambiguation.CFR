            purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of
            support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory
            criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is
            that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between
            the executive agency and the State, local government, or other
            recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the
            agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is
            acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of
            the Federal Government.

        <P>
          For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for
          determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined
          in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity
          incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State,
          local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
          in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost
          Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs
          incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with
          the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit
          Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of
          higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of
          OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The
          allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in
          accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of

             When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has
            the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in
            the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government
            and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers
            appropriate. Such property is “exempt property.” Should a Federal
            awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property
            upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further
            obligation to the Federal Government.

             When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may
            be used for other activities in accordance with the following
            standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value
            of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other
            uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal
            awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall
            be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in
            the cost of the original project or program to the current fair
            market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the
            equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from
            the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall
            determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the
            agency&apos;s requirements. If no requirement exists within that
            agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the
            General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to
            determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other
            Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue
            instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after
            the recipient&apos;s request and the following procedures shall
            govern.

        <P>
          The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient
          of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The
          recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the
          Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of
          all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements
          entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes
          disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other
          matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of
          statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority
          as may have proper jurisdiction.

          The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing
          the performance of its employees engaged in the award and
          administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall
          participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract
          supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest
          would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee,
          officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or
          her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ
          any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest
          in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents
          of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors,
          or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to
          subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in
          which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an
          unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall
          provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such
          standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

          All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to
          provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition.
          The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interests
          as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may
          restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In
          order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair
          competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft
          specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids
          and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for
          such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose
          bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most
          advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors
          considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements
          that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer
          to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be
          rejected when it is in the recipient&apos;s interest to do so.

          Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in
          the procurement files in connection with every procurement action.
          Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the
          comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar
          indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and
          evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness,
          allocability and allowability.
