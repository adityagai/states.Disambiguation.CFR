            marketing year, the Board may hold meetings for the purpose of
            computing its marketing policy for that year and shall do so for the
            purpose of submitting any recommendations on its policy to the
            Secretary. The Board may designate one of its employees to compute
            and announce the preliminary computed free and restricted
            percentages.

             If the Board determines that volume regulation would tend to

            announce an inshell trade demand for that year prior to September
            20. The inshell trade demand shall equal the average of the
            preceding three years&apos; trade acquisitions of inshell hazelnuts:

            acquisitions during any or all of these years were abnormal because
            of crop or marketing conditions, the Board may use a prior year or
            years in determining the three-year average.

             Prior to September 20 of a marketing year, the Board shall compute
            and announce preliminary computed free and restricted percentages
            for that year, to release 80 percent of the inshell trade demand for
            that year. The preliminary computed free percentage shall be
            computed by multiplying that trade demand, adjusted by the declared
            carryin, by 80 percent, and by dividing that amount by the
            Board&apos;s estimate of orchard-run production less the average
            disappearance during the preceding three years, plus the undeclared
            carryin. The difference between 100 percent and the preliminary free
            percentage shall be the preliminary computed restricted percentage.
            At the same time, the Board may announce the portion of the
            restricted supply that may be shelled or exported, and the remainder
            of that supply to be disposed of in outlets approved by the Board

            100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously computed by the
            Board for the marketing year. The final free and restricted
            percentages may release an additional 15 percent of the average of
            the preceding three years&apos; trade acquisitions of inshell
            hazelnuts for desirable carryout. If the trade acquisitions during
            any or all of these years were abnormal, the Board may use a prior

            the end of the marketing year, or earlier as may be recommended by
            the Board and approved by the Secretary. The recommendations to the

             When the season average price of hazelnuts is not determined to be
            above parity, the Secretary may establish additional grade and size
            regulations for inshell hazelnuts in the form of a more restrictive
            minimum standard than that specified in paragraph (a) of this
            section, or pack specifications as to grades and sizes that may be
            handled, if he finds, on the basis of a recommendation of the Board
            or other information, that such regulations would tend to effectuate
            the declared policy of the act.

          submitted to the Secretary at the beginning of the fiscal year in

            produced from other than restricted hazelnuts that will provide
            sufficient funds to meet the authorized expenses and reserve

            other information, that a different rate is necessary, the Secretary

            to all such hazelnuts. Each handler shall pay to the Board on
            demand, assessments on all such assessable hazelnuts at the rate
            fixed by the Secretary, less any amounts credited pursuant to 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            fails to pay his assessment within the time prescribed by the Board.
            In the event the handler thereafter fails to pay the amount
            outstanding, including the late payment charge, within the
            prescribed time, the Board shall impose an additional charge in the
            form of interest on such outstanding amount. The rate of such
            charges shall be prescribed by the Board, with the approval of the
            Secretary.

          The Board shall maintain a list of approved users who are crushers,
          livestock feed manufacturers, or livestock feeders, and of the
          locations of the facilities to which substandard hazelnuts may be
          shipped. Users interested in purchasing substandard hazelnuts or
          hazelnut waste must make prior application to the Board on F/H Form D
          to be included on the approved list of such users. Each handler who
          disposes of substandard hazelnuts to an approved user shall, upon
          shipment, report to the Board on F/H Form D1 the quantities disposed
          of or shipped. Substandard hazelnuts disposed of to an approved user
          may only be shipped directly to an approved location where the
          crushing, feed manufacture, or feeding is to take place. The Board may
          deny approval to any user application, or may remove any user from the
          approved list when such denial or removal is deemed necessary to
          ensure control over disposition of substandard hazelnuts. This may
          occur if the Board determines that substandard hazelnuts are not
          properly shipped to, or utilized at, approved facilities, in
          compliance with this requirement. F/H Form D includes the location and
          description of the disposal facilities to be used as well as a
          certification to the Board and the Secretary of Agriculture that the

          monthly thereafter to the unpaid balance, including any accumulated
          interest. Any amount paid by a handler as assessments, including any
          charges imposed pursuant to this paragraph, shall be credited when the
