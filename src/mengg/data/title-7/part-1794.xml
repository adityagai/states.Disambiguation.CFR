        <P>
          In determining what are reasonable alternatives, RUS considers a
          number of factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to,
          the proposed action&apos;s size and scope, state of the technology,
          economic considerations, legal and socioeconomic concerns,
          availability of resources, and the timeframe in which the identified
          need must be fulfilled.

             The activity shall not have an adverse environmental impact and
            shall not preclude the search for other alternatives. For example,
            purchase of water rights, optioning or transfer of land title, or
            continued use of land as historically employed will not have an
            adverse environmental impact. However, site preparation or
            construction at or near the proposed site (e.g. rail spur) or
            development of a related facility (e.g. opening a captive mine)
            normally will have an adverse environmental impact.

             Expenditures are minimal. To be minimal, the expenditure must not
            exceed the amount of loss which the applicant could absorb without
            jeopardizing the Government&apos;s security interest in the event
            the proposed action is not approved by the Administrator, and must

            the meetings.

             The scoping meeting(s) will be held in the area of the proposed
            action at such place(s) as RUS determines will best afford an
            opportunity for public involvement. Any person or representative of
            an organization, or government body desiring to make a statement at
            the meeting may make such statement in writing or orally. The format
            of the meeting may be one of two styles. It can either be of the
            traditional style which features formal presentations followed by a
            comment period, or the open house style in which attendees are able
            to individually obtain information on topics or issues of interest
            within an established time period. The applicant or its consultant
            shall prepare a record of the scoping meeting. The record shall
            consist of a transcript when a traditional meeting format is used or
            a summary report when an open house format is used.

            environmental review. RUS will develop a proposed scope for further
            environmental study and review. RUS shall send a copy of this
            proposed scope to cooperating agencies and the applicant, and allow
            recipients 30 days to comment on the scope&apos;s adequacy and
            emphasis. After expiration of the 30-day period, RUS shall provide
            written guidance to the applicant concerning the scope of
            environmental study to be performed and information to be gathered.
