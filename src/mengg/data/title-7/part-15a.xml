            of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry
            are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by this
            part.

          A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by this subpart
          provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational
          qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with
          regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the
          employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action
          pursuant to this section which is based upon alleged comparative
          employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or
          the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient,
          employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this
          section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee&apos;s
          sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used
          only by members of one sex.
