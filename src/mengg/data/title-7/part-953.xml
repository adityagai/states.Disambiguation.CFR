          , the committee shall prepare a marketing policy, and promptly submit
          a copy thereof to the Secretary, setting forth its proposed policy for
          the marketing of potatoes during such fiscal period. In the event it
          becomes advisable to deviate from such marketing policy, because of
          changed demand and supply conditions, or as the Secretary may request,
          the committee shall formulate a revised marketing policy and shall
          submit a report thereon to the Secretary. Notice of each such
