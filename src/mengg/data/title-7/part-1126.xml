             The applicable shipping percentages of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
            this section may be increased or decreased by the market
            administrator if the market administrator finds that such adjustment
            is necessary to encourage needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic
            shipments. Before making such a finding, the market administrator
            shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market
            administrator&apos;s own initiative or at the request of interested
            parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to
            the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If
            the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping
            percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall
            issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and
            invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an
            applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least
            one day before the effective date.

             The delivery requirement in paragraph (d)(1) and the diversion
            percentages in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section may be
            increased or decreased by the market administrator if there is a
            finding that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing
            and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making
            such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need
            for the revision either on the market administrator&apos;s own
            initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is
            made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the
            requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows
            that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall
            issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and
            inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise
            the delivery day requirement or any diversion percentage must be
            issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.
