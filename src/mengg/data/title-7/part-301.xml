             If granted, a special need exception will be applicable for 2
            years, at the end of which the State or political subdivision of a
            State must submit a request for renewal of the exception. A special
            need renewal request must address the same criteria as the initial
            request submitted under 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            continuation of the special need exception. The renewal must be

            to the end of the 2-year applicability period for the initial
            exception. Once a special need renewal request has been received,
            APHIS will follow the same notice and comment process outlined in
            paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If, by the end of the 2-year
            applicability period, the State or political subdivision of a State
            does not submit a special need renewal request, the State&apos;s or
            political subdivision&apos;s special need exception will lapse and
            the State or political subdivision of a State will have to reapply
            for the special need exception.

            are not limited to, the availability of new scientific data or
            changes in APHIS regulations. Following the close of the comment

             In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this
            section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each
            State, or each portion of a State, in which a fruit fly population
            subject to the regulations in this subpart has been found by an
            inspector, or in which the Administrator has reason to believe that
            a fruit fly population is present, or that the Administrator
            considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for
            quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which a fruit fly
            population has been found. The Administrator will publish the
            description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and
            Quarantine Web site, 
            <E T='03'>
              http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/fruit_flies/index.shtml.
            </E>
             The description of the quarantined area will include the date the
            description was last updated and a description of the changes that
            have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the
            quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local
            office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories.
            After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a
            notice in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register
            </E>

            larvae. Determination of the time period must be based on the day
            degrees model for the specific fruit fly. Once treatment has begun,
            it must continue through the harvest period. The malathion bait
            spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a
            rate of 2.4 oz of technical grade malathion and 9.6 oz of protein
            hydrolysate per acre. The spinosad bait spray treatment must be
            applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 0.01 oz of a
            USDA-approved spinosad formulation and 48 oz of protein hydrolysate
            per acre. For ground applications, the mixture may be diluted with
            water to improve coverage.

             Testing is performed by the Agricultural Research Service of USDA

             Infected wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust, are placed
            on top of the screen. The plants are moistened and maintained in
            100% humidity, causing the spores to swell and fall on the plants
            lying under the screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at
            20-80% relative humidity. This test procedure is repeated 12 times.
            If in all 12 tests, the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of
            infection after 7 days and the test plants do not, USDA will declare
            the test plant variety rust-resistant. The tests must be performed
            on new growth, just as the leaves are unfolding.

            maximum distance of 20 feet apart if they can observe all plants
            growing within 10 feet of them. In areas of high plant growth or
            hilly terrain, the inspectors must be closer together due to limited
            or obstructed visibility. Inspectors must observe all plants growing
            between themselves and the mid-point of the distance between
            themselves and the next inspector. This process must be repeated so

            the circumference of an imaginary circle having the property as its
            mid-point, is visually inspected in this manner.

            the withdrawal, in writing, within 20 days of oral notification of
            the withdrawal. Any person whose certificate has been withdrawn may
            appeal the decision, in writing within 10 days after receiving
            written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of
            the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the
            certificate was wrongfully withdrawn. A hearing will be held to
            resolve any conflict as to any material fact. An appeal shall be
            granted or denied, in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow,
            and the reasons for the decision shall be stated. In a non-protected
            area, appeal shall be made to the Administrator. The Administrator
            shall adopt rules of practice for the hearing. The certificate will
            remain withdrawn pending decision of the appeal.

            compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in

            notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the

            determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has
            not complied with all conditions under this subpart for the use of
            the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the
            withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in
            writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose
            certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the
            decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after
            receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal
            must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies
            to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully
            withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator
            will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for
            the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to
            any material fact. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will
            be adopted by the Administrator.

             Any compliance agreement may be canceled orally or in writing by an
            inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person who has
            entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this
            subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the
            reasons for the cancellation shall be confirmed in writing as
            promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance
            agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing,
            within 10 days after receiving written notification of the
            cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons
            upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement
            was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the
            Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the
            reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any
            conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning such
            a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

            this section, each State or each portion of a State in which the

            Administrator has reason to believe that the Asian longhorned beetle
            is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to
            regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement
            purposes from localities where Asian longhorned beetle has been
            found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined

             The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any
            nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the
            criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The
            Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the
            owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the
            case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the
            management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate
            movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily
            designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon
            as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of
            designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or
            the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or

            person responsible for the management of, an area for which the
            designation is terminated will be given written notice of the

             When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means
            of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the
            inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to
            determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the
            regulated article. Articles found to

            disposed of.

            cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective
            immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the
            cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances

            cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances

             The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any
            nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the
            criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The
            Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the
            owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the
            case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the
            management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate
            movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily
            designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon
            as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of
            designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or
            the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or
            person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the
            person responsible for the management of, an area for which the
            designation is terminated 
            <PRTPAGE P='65' />
            will be given written notice of the termination as soon as
            practicable.

            cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances
            permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been
            canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator

            If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for

            because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes

            section will be compensated according to the following table on a
            per-acre basis at a rate based on the age of the trees destroyed. If
            the trees were not destroyed by the date specified on the emergency
            action notification, the compensation payment will be reduced by 10
            percent and by any tree removal costs incurred by the State or the
            U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The maximum USDA compensation
            rate is 85 percent of the loss in value, adjusted for any
            State-provided compensation to ensure total compensation from all
            sources does not exceed 100 percent of the loss in value.

             Owners of commercial stone fruit orchards who meet the eligibility
            requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section will be
            compensated according to the following table on a per-acre basis at
            a rate based on the age of the trees destroyed. If the trees were
            not destroyed by the date specified on the emergency action
            notification, the compensation payment will be reduced by 10 percent
            and by any tree removal costs incurred by the State or the U.S.
            Department of Agriculture (USDA). The maximum USDA compensation rate
            is 85 percent of the loss in value, adjusted for any State-provided
            compensation to ensure total compensation from all sources does not
            exceed 100 percent of the loss in value.

            than an entire State may be designated as a commercial
            citrus-producing area only if the Administrator determines that the
            area not included as a commercial citrus-producing area does not
            contain commercial citrus plantings; that the State has adopted and
            is enforcing a prohibition on the intrastate movement from areas not
            designated as commercial citrus-producing areas to commercial
            citrus-producing areas of fruit which are designated as regulated
            articles and which were moved interstate from a quarantined State
            pursuant to a limited permit; and that the designation of less than
            the entire State as a commercial citrus-producing area will
            otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of citrus
            canker.

             A certificate or limited permit may be withdrawn by an inspector if
            the inspector determines that any of the applicable requirements of
            this subpart have not been met. The decision of the inspector and
            the reason for the withdrawal must be confirmed in writing as
            promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or
            limited permit is withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to
            the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written
            notification. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons
            upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited
            permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator must grant or
            deny the appeal in writing, stating the reasons for the decision, as
            promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any
            material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules
            of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the
            Administrator.

             The form necessary to apply for funds to replace commercial citrus
            trees may be obtained from any local citrus canker eradication
            program office in Florida, or from the USDA Citrus Canker
            Eradication Program, 6901 West Sunrise Boulevard, Plantation, FL
            33313. The completed application should be accompanied by a copy of
            the public order directing the destruction of the trees and its
            accompanying inventory that describes the number and the variety of
            trees removed. Your completed application must be sent to the USDA
            Citrus Canker Eradication Program, Attn: Commercial Tree Replacement
            Program, c/o Division of Plant Industry, 3027 Lake Alfred Road,
            Winter Haven, FL 33881. Claims for trees destroyed on or before
            October 16, 2000, must have been received on or before December 15,
            2000. Claims for trees destroyed after October 16, 2000, must be
            received within 60 days after the destruction of the trees. The
            Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, approve the
            consideration of late claims when it appears that the claim was late
            through no fault of the owner of the trees, in the opinion of the
            Administrator. However, any request for consideration of a late
            claim must be submitted to the Administrator on or before August 19,
            2002 for trees destroyed on or before August 17, 2001, and within 1
            year after the destruction of the trees for trees destroyed after
            August 17, 2001.

            the public order directing the destruction of the trees and its
            accompanying inventory that describes the number and type of the

             Effective September 15, 2010, except as provided in paragraphs (b)
            and (c) of this section, all regulated nursery stock offered for
            commercial sale within an area quarantined for citrus greening must
            have an APHIS-approved plastic or metal tag on which a statement
            alerting consumers to Federal prohibitions regarding the interstate
            movement of the article is prominently and legibly displayed.
            Alternatively, if the article is destined for commercial sale in a
            box or container, the statement may be printed on the box or
            container, or printed on a label permanently affixed to the box or
            container, provided that, in either case, the statement is
            prominently and legibly displayed. The operator of the site of
            propagation of the nursery stock and the person offering the plants
            for commercial sale are jointly responsible for all such labeling.

            not complied with all of the provisions in this subpart or has not
            complied with all the conditions contained in the certificate or
            limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the
            reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as soon as
            circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit
            has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the
            Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written
            notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the
            facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the
            certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly
            as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the
            appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing
            will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules
            of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the
            Administrator.

            movement. The compliance agreement will also specify that APHIS may

          All nursery stock intended for interstate movement for immediate
          export from an area quarantined for citrus greening, must be inspected
          by an inspector

          <FTREF />
          /&gt; no more than 72 hours prior to movement. The person who desires
          to move the articles interstate must notify the inspector as far in
          advance of the desired interstate movement as possible. The articles
          must be inspected at the place and in the manner the inspector
          designates as necessary to comply with this subpart. If the inspector
          has reason to believe that the interstate movement of the articles may
          lead to the artificial spread of citrus greening or Asian citrus
          psyllid, he or she may deny issuance of a limited permit for
          interstate movement of the article or take other remedial measures to
          prohibit such spread.

          Any certificate, limited permit, or compliance agreement may be
          canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector
          determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit, or
          the person who has 
          <PRTPAGE P='115' />
          entered into the compliance agreement, has not complied with this
          subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the
          cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective
          immediately and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation
          will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances allow within 20
          days after oral notification of the cancellation. Any person whose
          certificate, limited permit, or compliance agreement has been canceled
          may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving
          the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the
          facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider
          in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any conflict
          as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be
          adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the
          Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the
          reasons for the decision.

          This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is

          . Such compliance agreements shall state the specific requirements
          that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in accordance with the
          requirements of the program. Certificates and a nursery identification

             If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an
            inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates
            for movement will be suspended until necessary treatments are
            applied and the plants and nursery premises are determined to be
            free of the imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may
            declare a nursery to be free of the imported fire ant upon
            reinspection of the premises. This inspection must be conducted no
            sooner than 30 days after treatment. During this period,
            certification may be based upon treatments for plants in accordance
            with

             Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of
            destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found
            on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire
            ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin must cease
            its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation
            by Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to
            determine the probable source of the problem and to ensure that the
            problem is resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of
            certification for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free
            premises will be suspended until treatment and elimination of the
            infestation is completed. Reinstatement into the program will be
            granted upon determination that the nursery premises are free of the
            imported fire ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are
            being followed.

            of the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has
            been suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days

            any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the

            in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate
            as a quarantined area each field that has been found to be infested
            with pale cyst nematode, each field that has been found to be
            associated with an infested field, and any area that the
            Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its
            inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or
            associated fields. The Administrator will publish the description of
            the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web
            site, 
            <E T='03'>

            </E>
            . The description of the quarantined area will include the date the
            description was last updated and a description of the changes that
            have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the
            quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local
            office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories.
            After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a
            notice in the 
            <E T='04'>
              Federal Register
            </E>
             informing the public that the change has occurred and describing

             If the Administrator has quarantined any area other than infested
            or associated fields because of its inseparability for quarantine
            enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields, as provided
            in paragraph (a) of this section, that area will be removed from
            quarantine when the relevant infested or associated fields are
            removed from quarantine.

            of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the
            inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to
            determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the
            regulated article. Articles found to be infested by an inspector,
            and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart,
            may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial
            measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.

            certificate or limited permit or has not complied with all the

             Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in
            writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the
            person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to
            comply with any of the provisions of this subpart. If the
            cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the
            cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as
            circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been

            within 10 days after receiving written notification of the
            cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons

            reasons for the cancellation shall be confirmed in writing as

            agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, to
            the Deputy Administrator within ten days after receiving written
            notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the
            facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the

            <PRTPAGE P='137' />
            this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this
            designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated
            area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person
            responsible for the management of the nonregulated area. Thereafter,
            the movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily
            designated as a regulated area is subject to this subpart. As soon
            as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of
            designated regulated areas in paragraph (g) of this section, or the
            Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in
            possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person
            responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation
            is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as
            soon as practicable.

             When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means
            of conveyance is moving a regulated article, the inspector is
            authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine
            whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated
            article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and articles
            not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be
            seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures,
            destroyed, or otherwise disposed of. Any treatments will be in

        <P>
          Any certificate, limited permit, or compliance agreement may be
          canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector
          determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit, or
          the person who has entered into the compliance agreement, has not
          complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this
          subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become
          effective immediately and the cancellation and the reasons for the
          cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances
          allow, but within 20 days after oral notification of the cancellation.
          Any person whose certificate, limited permit, or compliance agreement
          has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days
          after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state
          all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator
          to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve
          any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the
          hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable,
          the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating
          the reasons for the decision.

             Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive
            compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with
            paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown
            in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary
            emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that
            became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for

            remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the
            time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in
            Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive
            compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that
            meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers,
            and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season
            are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop
            season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were
            unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation

            crop season must be received by FSA on or before December 4, 2001.
            Claims for compensation for subsequent crop seasons must be received
            by FSA on or before March 1 of the year following that crop season.
            The Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific
            cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent
            or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these
            dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company
            must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the

            Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy of the
            Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt
            test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated)
            weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a

            documentation showing that the wheat is either certified seed or was
            grown with the intention of producing certified seed (this

            uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for Karnal bunt spores
            during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible for compensation in
            accordance with this paragraph. The grower is eligible for
            compensation for the costs of disposing of such wheat seed, by
            burial on the grower&apos;s premises, by burial at a landfill, or
            through another means approved by APHIS. The compensation for
            disposing of wheat seed by burial on the grower&apos;s premises is
            $1.00 per bushel. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by
            burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS, is
            the actual cost of disposal, up to $1.20 per bushel, as verified by
            receipts for disposal costs. To apply for this compensation, the
            grower must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided
            by FSA, and must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate
            issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and
            verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the
            uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for spores (such as a
            copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For seed
            disposed of by burial at a landfill the grower must also submit one
            or more receipts for the disposal costs of the uncertified wheat
            seed, showing the total bushels destroyed and the total disposal
            costs (landfill fees, transportation costs, etc.).

             Owners of grain storage facilities that are in States where the
            Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency, and who have
            decontaminated their grain storage facilities pursuant to either an
            Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector
            or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the
            facilities, are eligible to be compensated, on a one time only basis
            for each facility for each covered crop year wheat, for up to 50
            percent of the direct cost of decontamination. However, compensation
            will not exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility (as defined in

            from compensation. Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To
            claim compensation, the owner of the grain storage facility must
            submit to an inspector records demonstrating that decontamination
            was performed on all structures, conveyances, or materials ordered
            by APHIS to be decontaminated. The records must include a copy of
            the Emergency Action Notification or the letter from an inspector
            ordering decontamination, contracts with individuals or companies
            hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment and
            materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for
            employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities
            connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that
            helps show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been
            completed. Claims for compensation for the 1999-

            beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop
            season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written
            request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances
            occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation

             Flour millers who, in accordance with a compliance agreement with
            APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by APHIS to be heat
            treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of $35.00 per
            short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated will be
            calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated
            area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of
            millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments
            will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must
            submit to an inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated)
            weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a
            copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight
            appears on those documents, or other verification). Flour millers
            must also submit verification that the millfeed was heat treated
            (such as a copy of the limited permit under which the wheat was
            moved to a treatment facility and a copy of the bill of lading
            accompanying that movement; or a copy of PPQ Form 700 (which
            includes certification of processing) signed by the inspector who
            monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop
            season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001.
            Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond

             The owner of the grain storage facility will be compensated for the

            be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account
            the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed,
            milling, or export) during the relevant time period for that
            facility, with adjustments for transportation and other handling
            costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under
            any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat
            will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim
            compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA
            office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The
            owner of the facility must also submit to FSA a copy of the
            Emergency Action Notification or letter from an inspector under
            which the facility is or was quarantined; verification as to the
            actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a

             Any compliance agreement may be cancelled orally or in writing by
            the inspector who is supervising its enforcement whenever the
            inspector finds that such person has failed to comply with the
            provisions of this subpart or any conditions imposed pursuant
            thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons
            therefor shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances
            permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been cancelled may
            appeal the decision, in writing, to the Deputy Administrator within
            ten (10) days after receiving written notification of the
            cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons
            upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement
            was wrongfully cancelled. The Deputy Administrator shall grant or
            deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision,
            as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to
            any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict.
            Rules of Practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the
            Deputy Administrator.

            the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph

             The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any
            nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance
            with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will give a

            temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the
            nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any
            regulated, restricted, or associated article from an area
            temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this
            subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list
            in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the designation will be
            terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person
            in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be
            given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

            Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants if symptomatic
            plants are present. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present,
            each symptomatic plant must be sampled and the remainder of the 40
            sample minimum must be taken from asymptomatic plants. If no
            symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be
            sampled; biased toward proven hosts. Each sample may contain more
            than one leaf, and may come from more than one plant, but all plants
            in the sample must be from the same lot. Asymptomatic samples, if
            collected, must be taken from regulated and associated articles and
            nearby plants. Inspectors must conduct inspections at times when the
            best expression of symptoms is anticipated and must take nursery
            fungicide programs into consideration. Nursery owners must keep
            records of fungicide applications for 2 years and must make them
            available to inspectors upon request.
