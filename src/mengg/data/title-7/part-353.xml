        <P>
          The export certification program does not require certification of any
          exports, but does provide certification of plants and plant products
          as a service to exporters. After assessing the phytosanitary condition
          of the plants or plant products intended for export, relative to the
          receiving country&apos;s regulations, an inspector issues an
          internationally recognized phytosanitary certificate (PPQ Form 577), a
          phytosanitary certificate for reexport (PPQ Form 579), or an export
          certificate for processed plant products (PPQ Form 578) if warranted.
          APHIS also enters into written agreements with industry to allow the
          issuance of industry-issued certificates giving assurance that a plant
          product has been handled, processed, or inspected in a manner required
          by a foreign government. An industry-issued certificate includes an
          ISPM 15 quality/treatment mark.

             An agreement may be terminated by any signatory to the agreement by
            giving written notice of termination to the other party. The
            effective date of the termination will be 15 days after the date of
            actual receipt of the written 
            <PRTPAGE P='462' />
            notice. Any agreement may be immediately withdrawn by the
            Administrator if he or she determines that articles covered by the
            agreement were moved in violation of any requirement of this chapter
            or any provision of the agreement. If the withdrawal is oral, the
            decision to withdraw the agreement and the reasons for the
            withdrawal of the agreement shall be confirmed in writing as
            promptly as circumstances permit. Withdrawal of an agreement may be
            appealed in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after
            receipt of the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal
            shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the appellant
            relies to show that the agreement was wrongfully withdrawn. The
            Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating
            the reasons for granting or denying the appeal as promptly as
            circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact
            and the person from whom the agreement is withdrawn requests a
            hearing, a hearing shall be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of
            practice concerning the hearing shall be adopted by the
            Administrator. No written agreement will be signed with an
            individual or a company representative of the concerned agricultural
            or forestry company or association who has had a written agreement
            withdrawn during the 12 months following such withdrawal, unless the
            withdrawn agreement was reinstated upon appeal.

             A non-government facility&apos;s compliance with the criteria of
            paragraph (b) of this section shall be determined through an
            assessment of the facility and its fitness to conduct the laboratory

            be accredited. If, after evaluating the results of the assessment,
            the Administrator determines that the facility meets the
            accreditation criteria, the facility&apos;s application for
            accreditation will be approved.

             In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be

            in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving
            notification of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts
            and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the facility
            was wrongfully denied accreditation. The Administrator will grant or
            deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit,
            stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict
            as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the

            proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days
            after being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The
            appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the

            are incorrect or do not support 
            <PRTPAGE P='463' />
            the withdrawal of the accreditation of the facility. The
            Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly

            If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be
            held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the

            shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding
            when the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to
            protect the public health, interest, or safety. Such withdrawal will
            be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is
            earlier, to the operator of the facility. In the event of oral
            notification, written confirmation will be given as promptly as
            circumstances allow. This withdrawal will continue in effect pending
            the completion of the proceeding, and any judicial review thereof,
            unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.

            is seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility

            team and commence the assessment as soon as circumstances permit.
            The assessment team will measure the facility&apos;s fitness to

             The fees charged by APHIS in connection with the initial
            accreditation of a non-government facility and the maintenance of
            that accreditation shall be adequate to recover the costs incurred
            by the government in the course of APHIS&apos; accreditation
            activities. To cover those costs, the operator of the facility
            seeking accreditation must enter into a trust fund agreement with
            APHIS under which the operator of the facility will pay in advance
            all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its
            involvement in the pre-accreditation assessment process and the
            maintenance of the facility&apos;s accreditation. Those costs shall
            include administrative expenses incurred in those activities, such
            as laboratory fees for evaluating check test results, and all
            salaries (including overtime 
            <PRTPAGE P='465' />
            and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses
            (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses
            incurred by the APHIS in performing those activities. The operator
            of the facility must deposit a certified or cashier&apos;s check
            with APHIS for the amount of the costs, as estimated by APHIS. If
            the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS,
            the operator of the facility must deposit another certified or
            cashier&apos;s check with APHIS for the amount of the remaining
            costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS&apos; services will be
            completed. After a final audit at the conclusion of the
            pre-accreditation assessment, any overpayment of funds will be
            returned to the operator of the facility or held on account until
            needed for future activities related to the maintenance of the
            facility&apos;s accreditation.

             The facility must conduct its laboratory seed health testing and
            seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures in accordance with
            Reference Manual B. The facility must have a quality manual
            documenting its quality system for laboratory seed health testing
            and seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures. The quality
            system must follow the general guidelines described in ANSI/ASQC
            Q9001-1994, 
            <E T='03'>

             Evaluation of plant or tissue samples must be undertaken by a plant
            pathologist or by laboratory technicians under the supervision of a
            plant pathologist, who may provide such supervision either on-site,
            or from a remote location. Where personnel are required to be
            trained at a facility to evaluate the particular types of plants or
            tissue samples handled by the facility, the training program must be
            evaluated by APHIS and determined to be effective.
