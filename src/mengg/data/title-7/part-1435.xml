            Subsequent review of the arbitration decision is available at the

             CCC will determine whether Louisiana sugar production, in the
            absence of proportionate shares, will exceed the quantity needed to
            enable processors to fill the State cane sugar allotment and provide
            a normal carryover inventory. If the determination is made that the
            quantity of sugar produced in Louisiana, plus a normal carryover
            inventory, will exceed the State&apos;s allotment, CCC will
            establish for each sugarcane producing farm a proportionate share
            that limits the sugarcane acreage that may be harvested on the farm
            for sugar or seed.

          Whenever CCC determines that, because of a natural disaster or other
          condition beyond the control of producers adversely affecting a
          sugarcane crop, the amount of sugarcane produced by producers subject
          to proportionate shares will not be sufficient to enable state
          processors to produce sufficient sugar to meet the State&apos;s cane
          sugar allotment and provide a normal carryover of sugar, CCC may
          uniformly allow producers to harvest sugarcane in excess of their
          proportionate shares, or suspend proportionate shares entirely.

             For bids in which the processor offers to remove acreage of sugar
            beets or sugarcane from production, CCC will rank bids on the basis
            of the bid amount as a percentage of the expected sugar produced
            from the retired acreage. Bids with the lowest of such percentages
            will be selected first. In the case of identical bids, selection may
            be based on random selection or pro rata shares, as CCC deems
            appropriate.
