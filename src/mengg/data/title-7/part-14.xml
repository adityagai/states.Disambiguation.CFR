        <P>
          Federal tax, conservation, natural resource, and environmental
          policies should complement rather than conflict with one another.
          Therefore, the Federal income tax liability on applicable payments
          should be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the payments yield
          conservation, environmental, forestry improvement, or wildlife
          benefits to the general public beyond the benefits that accrue to
          those who receive the payments.

             Soil deterioration refers to impairments of the physical or
            chemical properties of soil that are largely irreversible and that
            can be expected to result in a long-term or permanent reduction in
            the productive capacity of the resource regardless of the level of
            technology available or applied. Erosion by water and wind and the
            associated changes that result in permanent or long-term reductions
            in the productive capacity of the soil are forms of soil
            deterioration.
