             The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each
            handler during a fiscal period in an amount designated to secure
            funds sufficient to cover the expenses which may be incurred during

            approximately one fiscal period&apos;s expenses. At any time during
            or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the
            assessment rate in order to secure funds sufficient to cover any
            later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be
            incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cranberries acquired
            during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for
            the administration of the provisions of this part during the first
            part of a fiscal year, before sufficient operating income is
            available from assessments, the committee may accept the payment of
            assessments in advance and may also borrow money for such purposes.

             Sales histories, starting with the crop year following adoption of

            weight of the fruit paid for by the handler after cleaning and

           the quantity of screened cranberries contained in an unscreened lot
          shall be made in accordance with the following procedure and on the

             The cranberries in the sample are cleaned to remove chaff, and the
            boxes of cleaned berries are weighed. The weight of the boxes
            themselves is then deducted to determine the weight of the cleaned
            berries. The weight of the cleaned berries is divided by the number
            of boxes in the sample to obtain the net weight of cleaned
            cranberries per box. The net weight is multiplied by the number of
            boxes in the lot to obtain the net weight of the berries in the
            unscreened lot.
