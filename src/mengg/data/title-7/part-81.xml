            desires. Grafting another type of tree to the rootstock remaining
            after removing the prune/plum tree would not qualify as removal
            under this program.

             To be eligible for this program, the trees to be removed must have
            yielded at least 1.5 tons of dried prune/plums per net-planted acre
            during the 1999 or 2000 crop year. A net-planted acre is the actual
            acreage planted with prune-plum trees. Abandoned orchards and dead
            trees will not qualify. In new orchards diverted, qualifying trees
            must be at least 5 years of age (6th leaf), contain at least two
            scaffolds, and be capable of producing at least 1.5 tons per
            net-planted acre. The block of trees for removal must be easily
            definable by separations from other blocks and contain at least
            1,000 eligible trees or comprise an entire orchard.

            prune-plum trees on the land cleared under this program through June
            30, 2004. Participants bear responsibility for ensuring that trees
            are not replanted, whether by themselves, or by successors to the
            land, or by others, until after June 30, 2004. If trees are
            replanted before June 30, 2004, by any persons, participants must
            refund any USDA payment, with interest, made in connection with this
            tree removal program.
