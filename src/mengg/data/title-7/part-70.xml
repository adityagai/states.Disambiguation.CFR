          supervisor shall take such action as is necessary to correct the
          grading and to cause any improper grademarks which appear on the
          product or containers thereof to be corrected prior to shipment of the
          product from the place of initial grading.

          Normal operating schedules for a full week consist of a continuous
          8-hour period per day (excluding not to exceed 1 hour for lunch), 5
          consecutive days per week, within the administrative workweek, Sunday
          through Saturday, for each shift required. Less than 8-hour schedules
          may be requested and will be approved if a grader is available. Clock
          hours of daily operations need not be specified in the request,
          although as a condition of continued approval, the hours of operation
          shall be reasonably uniform from day to day. Graders are to be
          notified by management 1 day in advance of any change in the hours
          grading service is requested.

        <P>
          Pending final action by the Secretary, any person authorized to
          countersign a license to perform grading service may, whenever such
          action is deemed necessary to assure that any grading services are
          properly performed, suspend any license to perform grading service
          issued pursuant to this part, by giving notice of such suspension to
          the respective licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons
          therefor. Within 7 days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and
          statement of reasons, the licensee may file an appeal in writing, with
          the Secretary, supported by any argument or 
          <PRTPAGE P='207' />
          evidence that the licensee may wish to offer as to why the license
          should not be further suspended or revoked. After the expiration of
          the aforesaid 7-day period and consideration of such argument and
          evidence, the Secretary will take such action as deemed appropriate
          with respect to such suspension or revocation. When no appeal is filed
          within the prescribed 7 days, the license to perform grading service
          is revoked.

          the rules do not apply to cooperative employees not under Federal
          supervision and intermittent employees on the days they perform no

            which are not in accordance with the regulations in this part; or

            shall be promptly confirmed in writing and the reasons therefor
            shall be stated, except in instances where the person has already
            corrected the deficiency. Such service, after appropriate corrective

          Appeal grading certificates.
        </SUBJECT>
        <P>
          Immediately after an appeal grading is completed, an appeal
          certificate shall be issued to show that the original grading was
          sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate shall supersede any
          previously issued certificate for the product involved and shall
          clearly identify the number and date of the superseded certificate.
          The issuance of the appeal certificate may be withheld until any
          previously issued certificate and all copies have been returned when
          such action is deemed necessary to protect the interest of the
          Government. When the appeal grader assigns a different grade to the
          lot, the existing grademark shall be changed or obliterated as
          necessary. When the appeal grader assigns a different class or
          quantity designation to the lot, the labeling shall be corrected.
