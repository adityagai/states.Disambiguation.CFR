             Adequate loan security must be provided for loans made or

            mortgage lien on most of the borrower&apos;s assets substantially in
            the form set forth in appendix A of this subpart. At the discretion
            of RUS, this model form of mortgage may 
            <PRTPAGE P='177' />
            be adapted to satisfy different legal requirements among the states
            and individual differences in lending circumstances, provided that

            subpart.

            The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the policies,
            requirements, and procedures governing loan contracts entered into
            between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and distribution borrowers
            or, in some cases, other electric borrowers.

            The intent of this subpart is to provide the flexibility to address
            the different needs and different credit risks of individual
            borrowers, and other special circumstances of individual lending
            situations. The model loan contract contained in appendix A of this
            subpart provides an example of what a loan contract with an
            “average” or “typical” distribution borrower may look like under
            “average” or “typical” circumstances. Depending on the credit risks
            and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may execute loan
            contracts with provisions that are substantially different than
            those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model loan
            contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made
            available to the public.

            that obtain a loan or loan guarantee from RUS approved on or after
            January 29, 1996. Distribution borrowers that obtain a lien
            accommodation or any other form of financial assistance from RUS
            after January 29, 1996, may be required to execute a new loan
            contract and new mortgage. Moreover, any distribution borrower may
            submit a request to RUS that a new loan contract and new mortgage be
            executed. Within the constraints of time and staff resources, RUS
            will attempt to honor such requests. Borrowers must first obtain the
            concurrence of any other mortgagees on their existing mortgage
            before a new mortgage can be executed.

            such requests if it determines that such approval is in the
            government&apos;s financial interest. If other mortgagees are on the
            borrower&apos;s existing mortgage, their concurrence would be
            required before a new mortgage could be executed.
