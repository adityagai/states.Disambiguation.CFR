          Washington, DC 20250. A field representative will be assigned by RUS
          to visit the applicant and discuss its financial needs and
          eligibility. Existing borrowers initiate the contact directly with
          their assigned field representative. Borrowers consult with RUS field
          representatives and headquarters staff, as necessary.

             The RUS field representative assists the borrower in assembling
            this information. Certain information is required from initial loan
            applicants but usually not from borrowers seeking subsequent loans.
            Borrowers are to submit all information in paragraph (a) of this
            section to their RUS field representatives, who will review and then
            forward the packages to RUS headquarters.

             RUS will make a determination of completeness of the application
            package and will notify the borrower of this determination within 10
            working days of receipt of the information at RUS headquarters. If
            the application package is not complete, RUS will notify the
            borrower of what information is needed in order to complete the
            application package. If the information required to complete the
            application package is not received by RUS within 90 working days
            from the date the borrower was notified of the information needed,
            RUS may return the application package to the borrower. Returned
            applications are without prejudice and borrowers may resubmit the
            completed application.

          (the Area Coverage Survey) and (b) engineering studies to determine
          the system design that provides service most efficiently (the Loan
          Design). The RUS field representative confers with the borrower and
          its engineer to schedule the completion and submission of these
          studies.

             The objective of the ACS is to determine the location, number and
            telephone service requirements of subscribers in a service area. RUS
            will use the ACS to appraise the proposed plan for area coverage and
            to determine the largest practical number of rural subscribers which
            can be served on an economically feasible basis. Preparation of the

             A loan application requires supporting data collectively called a
            “Loan Design.” The LD contains a forecast of service requirements
            and a narrative with supporting exhibits. Most of the items included
            in the LD are similar for all loan applications. However, as noted
            below, there are certain additional requirements for initial loans
            and for any exchange areas not previously financed by RUS, and other
            additional requirements for subsequent loans for areas previously
            financed by RUS. The LD must conform to the borrower&apos;s state
            telecommunications modernization plan unless the borrower is seeking
            a guaranteed loan (for additional information concerning the plan,

             Because of the importance and complexity of the engineering studies
            necessary for the LD, it should be prepared by a competent
            experienced telecommunications engineer. While the LD is subject to
            RUS approval, the borrower&apos;s selection of an engineer to
            perform preloan work is not. Note: The borrower&apos;s selection of
            an engineer to perform postloan work

              is

             The LD for a subsequent loan (which only includes areas previously

            The detailed Outside Plant Design for these subsequent loans may be
            completed for RUS review and approval after loan approval, but
            before staking is started and plans and specifications are prepared.
            By scheduling preparation of the outside plant design closer to
            preparation for construction, the need for redesign resulting from
            changing conditions and its attendant costs are reduced.

             Under special circumstances a borrower may request that RUS approve
            interim financing for interim construction. This subpart describes

            financing of construction, the information to be submitted to RUS to
            support the borrower&apos;s request, RUS&apos;s requirements
            relating to interim construction, and related matters.

            nonloan funds to be used. The budget shall show, as applicable,

            projects,

            budgeted, exclusive of prior loan reserves, generally shall be
            rounded to the nearest $1,000.

             In connection with each loan RUS shall prepare a feasibility study
            that includes sections on consolidated loan estimates, operating
            statistics, projected telecommunications, plant, projected
            retirement computations, and projected revenue and expense estimates
            (including detailed estimates of depreciation and amortization
            expense, scheduled debt service payments, toll and access charge
            revenues, and local service revenues). Normally, projections will be
            for a 5-year period and used to determine the ability of the
            borrower to repay its loans in accordance with the terms thereof.
            RUS will not require borrowers to raise local service rates. Local
            service revenue projections will be based on the borrower&apos;s
            existing local service rates or regulatory body approved rates not
            yet in effect but to be implemented within the Forecast period. In
            the latter case, if a borrower is not required to obtain regulatory
            body approval for the implementation of such rates, RUS will require
            a resolution of the board of directors indicating when those rates
            will be in effect.

            feasibility study, the estimates generally may not vary from the
            standard by more than 20 percent to reflect the particular
            characteristics of the loan applicant. Any variation from the

             If it is determined that loan feasibility cannot be proven as
            described in this section, the loan application will be returned to
            the borrower with an explanation. A borrower whose application has
            been returned will have 90 working days, from the date the
            application was returned, to revise and resubmit its application. If
            a revised application is not received by RUS within the 90-day
            period described above, the application will be canceled and a new
            application will need to be submitted if the borrower wishes further
            consideration.

            concurrent RUS cost-of-money and RTB loans, the Administrator shall

            rate on the date of determination as described in paragraph (b) of
            this section. If the Treasury rate exceeds 7 percent, the interest
            rate used to determine eligibility for the RUS cost-of-money loan
            will be 7 percent.
