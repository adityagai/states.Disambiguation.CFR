          living expenses relating to the obtainment of a degree of Doctor of
          Veterinary Medicine from a college or school of veterinary medicine
          accredited by the AVMA Council on Education. Such loans must have
          documentation which is contemporaneous with the training received in a
          college or school of veterinary medicine. If qualifying educational
          loans are refinanced, the original documentation of the loan(s) will
          be required to be submitted to the Secretary to establish the
          contemporaneous nature of such loans.

            Reasonable living expenses

           means the ordinary living costs incurred by the program participant
          while attending the college of veterinary medicine, exclusive of
          tuition and educational expenses. Reasonable living expenses must be
          incurred during the period of attendance and may include food and
          lodging expenses, insurance, commuting and transportation costs.
          Reasonable living expenses must be equal to or less than the sum of
          the school&apos;s estimated standard student budgets for living
          expenses for the degree of veterinary medicine for the year(s) during
          which the program participant was enrolled in the school. However, if
          the school attended by the program participant did not have a standard
          student budget or if a program participant requests repayment for
          living expenses which are in excess of the standard student budgets
          described in the preceding sentence, the program participant must
          submit documentation, as required by the Secretary, to substantiate
          the reasonableness of living expenses incurred. To the extent that the
          Secretary determines, upon review of the program participant&apos;s
          documentation, that all or a portion of the living 
          <PRTPAGE P='502' />

            veterinarians to pay principal and interest on education loans of
            veterinarians who agree to work in veterinary shortage situations
            for a prescribed period of time. In addition, program participants
            may enter into an agreement to provide services to the Federal
            government in emergency situations in exchange for salary, travel,
            per diem expenses, and additional amounts of loan repayment
            assistance. The purpose of the program is to assure an adequate
            supply of trained food animal veterinarians in shortage situations
            and provide USDA with a pool of veterinary specialists to assist in
            the control and eradication of animal disease outbreaks.

             Loan repayments will be made directly to the loan provider on a

            equal to 39 percent of the loan repayments will be credited directly

            with each loan repayment.

             Once a service agreement has been signed by both parties, the

            that sufficient funds will be available to make loan repayments and
            tax payments, as specified in the service agreement, for the
            duration of the period of obligated service. Reimbursements for tax
            liabilities in excess of the amount provided (not to exceed 39
            percent of the amount of loan repayment or any other cap established
            by the Secretary) will be subject to the availability of funds.
            These additional tax payments, if available to the VMLRP
            participants, will be identified in the RFA and in the participant
            service agreement.
