          This part announces regulations under which the Secretary of
          Agriculture shall carry out the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
          for Women, Infants and Children (WIC Program). 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            Section 17 of
          </aref>
           the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended, states in part that the
          Congress finds that substantial numbers of pregnant, postpartum and
          breastfeeding women, infants and young children from families with
          inadequate income are at special risk with respect to their physical
          and mental health by reason of inadequate nutrition or health care, or
          both. The purpose of the Program is to provide supplemental foods and
          nutrition education, including breastfeeding 
          <PRTPAGE P='353' />
          promotion and support, through payment of cash grants to State
          agencies which administer the Program through local agencies at no
          cost to eligible persons. The Program shall serve as an adjunct to
          good health care during critical times of growth and development, in
          order to prevent the occurrence of health problems, including drug and
          other harmful substance abuse, and to improve the health status of
          these persons. The program shall be supplementary to SNAP; any program
          under which foods are distributed to needy families in lieu of SNAP
          benefits; and receipt of food or meals from soup kitchens, or
          shelters, or other forms of emergency food assistance.

          and soy-based infant formulas, all infant formulas issued under each
          contract are considered the contract brand infant formula (see

          State agency that are produced by the manufacturer that was awarded
          the milk-based contract are considered contract brand infant formulas.
          Similarly, all of the soy-based infant formulas issued by a State
          agency that are produced by the manufacturer that was awarded the
          soy-based contract are also considered to be contract brand infant
          formulas. Contract brand infant formulas also include all infant
          formulas (except exempt infant formulas) introduced after the contract
          is awarded.

             By August 15 of each year, each State agency shall submit to FNS
            for approval a State Plan for the following fiscal year as a
            prerequisite to receiving funds under this section. The State agency
            may submit the State Plan in the format provided by FNS guidance.
            Alternatively, the State agency may submit the Plan in combination
            with other federally required planning documents or develop its own
            format, provided that the information required below is included.
            FNS requests advance notification that a State agency intends to use
            an alternative format. The State Plan shall be signed by the State
            designated official responsible for ensuring that the Program is
            operated in accordance with the State Plan. FNS will provide written
            approval or denial of a completed State Plan or amendment within 30
            days of receipt. Within 15 days after FNS receives an incomplete
            Plan, FNS will notify the State agency that additional information
            is needed to complete the Plan. Any disapproval will be accompanied
            by a statement of the reasons for the disapproval. After receiving
            approval of the State Plan, each State agency shall only submit to
            FNS for approval substantive changes in the State Plan. A complete
            and approved Plan shall include:

             State agencies have the option to provide nutrition education
            materials to institutions participating in the CACFP at no cost, as
            long as a written agreement for sharing such materials is in place
            between the relevant WIC and CACFP entities. State agencies may
            initiate a sharing agreement with their State-level CACFP
            counterparts that would apply statewide, or may authorize their
            local agencies or clinics to initiate a sharing agreement at the
            local level with their local level CACFP counterparts.

             The State agency shall provide a written justification to FNS for
            not funding an agency to serve the highest priority area or special

            priority system (outlined in this paragraph (d)), and a request that
            potential local agencies notify the State agency of their interest.
            In addition, the State agency will contact all potential local
            agencies to make sure they are aware of the opportunity to apply. If
            an application is not submitted within 30 days, the State agency may
            then select a local agency in another area. If sufficient funds are
            available, a State agency will give notice and consider applications
            outside the local area at the same time.

             The State agency may conduct periodic reviews of the qualifications
            of authorized local agencies under its jurisdiction. Based upon the
            results of such reviews the State agency may make appropriate
            adjustments among the participating local agencies, including the
            disqualification of a local agency when the State agency determines
            that another local agency can operate the Program more effectively
            and efficiently. In conducting such reviews, the State agency shall
            consider the factors listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section in
            addition to whatever criteria it may develop. The State agency shall
            implement the procedures established in paragraph (e)(3) of this
            section when disqualifying a local agency.

             The State agency shall provide each local WIC agency with materials
            showing the maximum income limits, according to family size,
            applicable to pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 5
            under the medical assistance program established under Title XIX of
            the Social Security Act (in this section, referred to as the
            “Medicaid Program”). The local agency shall, in turn, provide to
            adult individuals applying or reapplying for the WIC Program for
            themselves or on behalf of others, written information about the
            Medicaid Program. If such individuals are not currently
            participating in Medicaid but appear to have family income below the
            applicable maximum income limits for the program, the local agency
            shall also refer these individuals to Medicaid, including the
            referral of infants and children to the appropriate

            authorized to determine presumptive eligibility for the Medicaid
            Program, if such determinations are being offered by the State.

             At certification, the State or local agency must require each
            applicant to present proof of residency (i.e., location or address
            where the applicant routinely lives or spends the night) and proof
            of identity. The State or local agency must also check the identity
            of participants, or in the case of infants or children, the identity
            of the parent or guardian, or proxies when issuing food, cash-value
            vouchers or food instruments. The State agency may authorize the
            certification of applicants when no proof of residency or identity
            exists (such as when an applicant or an applicant&apos;s parent is a
            victim of theft, loss, or disaster; a homeless individual; or a
            migrant farmworker). In these cases, the State or local agency must
            require the applicant to confirm in writing his/her residency or
            identity. Further, an individual residing in a remote Indian or
            Native village or an individual served by an Indian tribal
            organization and residing on a reservation or pueblo may establish
            proof of residency by providing the State agency their mailing
            address and the name of the remote Indian or Native village.

             For a State agency opting to require proof of pregnancy, the State
            agency may issue benefits to applicants who claim to be pregnant
            (assuming that all other eligibility criteria are met) but whose
            conditions (as pregnant) are not visibly noticeable and do not have
            documented proof of pregnancy at the time of the certification
            interview and determination. The State agency should then allow a
            reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, for the applicant
            to provide the requested documentation. If such documentation is not
            provided as requested, the woman can no longer be considered
            categorically eligible, and the local agency would then be justified
            in terminating the woman&apos;s WIC participation in the middle of a
            certification period.

            However, for breastfeeding women 6-12 months postpartum, such
            hematological tests are not required if a test was performed after
            the termination of their pregnancy. In addition, such hematological
            tests are not required, but are permitted, for infants under nine
            months of age. All infants nine months of age and older (who have
            not already had a hematological test performed or obtained, between
            the ages of six and nine months), shall have a hematological test
            performed between nine and twelve months of age or obtained from
            referral sources. This hematological test does not have to occur
            within 90 days of the date of certification. Only one test is
            required for children between 12 and 24 months of age, and this test
            should be done 6 months after the infant test, if possible. At the
            State or local agency&apos;s discretion, the hematological test is
            not required for children ages two and older who were determined to
            be within the normal range at their last certification. However, the
            hematological test shall be performed on such children at least once
            every 12 months. Hematological test data submitted by a competent
            professional authority not on the staff of the local agency may be
            used to establish nutritional risk. However, such referral

            within 90 days, unless the nutritional risk evaluation performed
            does not identify a qualifying risk factor. If no qualifying risk

            elapses. Under the subsequent determination process, if the woman

            found ineligible to participate in the program under this paragraph
            shall be advised in writing of the ineligibility, of the reasons for
            the ineligibility, and of the right to a fair hearing. The reasons

            the local agency shall maintain a waiting list of individuals who

            inclusion. State agencies may establish a policy which permits or
            requires local agencies to accept telephone requests for placement
            on the waiting list. The waiting list shall include the
            person&apos;s name, address or phone number, status (e.g., pregnant,
            breastfeeding, age of applicant), and the date he or she was placed
            on the waiting list. Individuals shall be notified of their
            placement on a waiting list within 20 days after they visit the
            local agency during clinic office hours to request Program benefits.
            For those State agencies establishing procedures to accept telephone
            requests for placement on a waiting list, individuals shall be
            notified of their placement on a waiting list within 20 days after
            contacting the local agency by phone. The competent professional
            authority shall apply the participant priority system as specified
            in paragraph (e)(4) of this section to the waiting list to ensure
            that the highest priority persons become Program participants first
            when caseload slots become available.

            required in cases where sufficient time does not exist to effect the
            change. Sufficient time means 90 days or less before the expiration
            of the certification period.

             The local agency must disqualify a participant and any other
            household members currently receiving WIC benefits who are
            determined ineligible based on the mid-certification income
            reassessment. However, adjunctively-eligible WIC participants (as
            defined in paragraphs (d)(2)(vi)(A) or (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this
            section) may not be disqualified from the WIC Program solely because
            they, or certain family members, no longer participate in one of the
            other specified programs. The State agency will ensure that such
            participants and other household members currently receiving WIC
            benefits are disqualified during a certification period only after
            their income eligibility has been reassessed based on the income
            screening procedures used for applicants who are not adjunctively
            eligible.

             If a State agency experiences funding shortages, it may be
            necessary to discontinue Program benefits to some certified
            participants. The State agency must explore alternatives (such as
            elimination of new certifications) before taking such action. In
            discontinuing benefits, the State agency will affect the least
            possible number of participants and those whose nutritional and
            health status would be least impaired by the action. When a State
            agency elects to discontinue benefits due to insufficient funds, it
            will not enroll new participants during that period. The State may
            discontinue benefits by:

            continued benefits, as decided by the hearing official. If the

            that the request for appeal is made within 15 days of the mailing
            date of the hearing decision notice. If the decision being appealed
            concerns disqualification from the Program, the appellant shall not
            continue to receive benefits while an appeal to the State agency of
            a decision rendered on appeal at the local level is pending. The
            decision of a hearing official at the local level is binding on the
            local agency and the State agency unless it is appealed to the State
            level and overturned by the State hearing official.

             Due to the nature of the health conditions of participants who are
            issued supplemental foods that require medical documentation, close
            medical supervision is essential for each participant&apos;s dietary
            management. The responsibility remains with the participant&apos;s
            health care provider for this medical oversight and instruction.
            This responsibility cannot be assumed by personnel at the WIC State
            or local agency. However, it would be the responsibility of the WIC
            competent professional authority to ensure that only the amounts of
            supplemental foods prescribed by the participant&apos;s health care
            provider are issued in the participant&apos;s food package.

            premature birth, low birth weight, failure to thrive, inborn errors
            of metabolism and metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders,
            malabsorption syndromes, immune system disorders, severe food

            formulas and WIC-eligible medical foods that are authorized or could
            be authorized under the State Medicaid Program for reimbursement and
            that are prescribed for WIC participants who are also Medicaid
            recipients. The WIC State agency is responsible for providing up to
            the maximum amount of exempt infant formulas and WIC-eligible
            medical foods under Food Package III in situations where
            reimbursement is not provided by another entity.

             The State agency must consider the business integrity of a vendor

            application. The State agency is not required to establish a formal
            system of background checks for vendor applicants. Unless denying
            authorization of a vendor applicant would result in inadequate
            participant access, the State agency may not authorize a vendor
            applicant if during the last six years the vendor applicant or any
            of the vendor applicant&apos;s current owners, officers, or managers
            have been convicted of or had a civil judgment entered against them
            for any activity indicating a lack of business integrity. Activities
            indicating a lack of business integrity include fraud, antitrust
            violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or
            destruction of records, making false statements, receiving stolen
            property, making false claims, and obstruction of justice. The State

             Must ensure that the prices of above-50-percent vendors do not
            inflate the competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement
            levels for the peer groups or result in higher total food costs if
            program participants transact their food instruments at
            above-50-percent vendors rather than at other vendors that do not
            meet the above-50-percent criterion. To comply with this
            requirement, the State agency must compare the average cost of each
            type of food instrument redeemed by above-50-percent vendors against
            the average cost of the same type of food instrument redeemed by
            regular vendors. The average cost per food instrument may be
            weighted to reflect the relative proportion of food instruments
            redeemed by each category of vendors in the peer group system. The
            State agency must compute statewide average costs per food
            instrument at least quarterly to monitor compliance with this
            requirement. If average payments per food instrument for
            above-50-percent vendors exceed average payments per food instrument
            to regular vendors, then the State agency must take necessary action
            to ensure compliance, such as adjusting payment levels. Where EBT
            systems are in use, it may be more appropriate to compare prices of
            individual WIC food items to ensure that average payments to
            above-50-percent vendors do not exceed average payments for the same
            food item to comparable vendors. If FNS determines that a State
            agency has failed to ensure that above-50-percent vendors do not
            result in higher costs to the program than if participants transact
            their food instruments at regular vendors, FNS will establish a
            claim against the State agency to recover excess food funds expended
            and will require remedial action. A State agency may exclude
            partially-redeemed food instruments from a quarterly cost neutrality
            assessment based on an empirical methodology approved by FNS. A
            State agency may not exclude food instruments from the quarterly
            cost neutrality assessment based on a rate of partially-redeemed
            food instruments.

             Must determine whether vendor applicants are expected to be
            above-50-percent vendors. The State agency must ask vendor
            applicants whether they expect to derive more than 50 percent of
            their annual revenue from the sale of food items from transactions
            involving WIC food instruments. This question applies whether or not
            the State agency chooses to authorize above-50-percent vendors. A
            vendor who answers in the affirmative must be treated as an
            above-50-percent vendor. The State agency must further assess a
            vendor who answers in the negative, by first calculating WIC
            redemptions as a percent of total food sales in existing
            WIC-authorized stores owned by the vendor applicant. Second, the
            State agency must calculate or request from the vendor applicant the
            percentage of anticipated food sales by type of payment, 
            <E T='03'>
              i.e.
            </E>
            , cash, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, WIC, and
            credit/debit card. Third, the State 
            <PRTPAGE P='408' />
            agency must review either the inventory invoices for food items, or
            the actual food items present at the preauthorization visit required
            by paragraph (g)(5) of this section, or both. Fourth, the State
            agency must determine whether WIC authorization is required in order
            for the store to open for business. If the vendor would be expected
            to be an above-50-percent vendor under any of these criteria, then
            the vendor must be treated as an above-50-percent vendor. State
            agencies may use additional data sources and methodologies, if
            approved by FNS.

             Must determine whether a currently authorized vendor meets the
            above-50-percent criterion, based on the State agency&apos;s
            calculation of WIC redemptions as a percent of the vendor&apos;s
            total foods sales for the same period. If WIC redemptions are more
            than 50 percent of the total food sales, the vendor must be deemed
            to be an above-50-percent vendor. As an initial step in identifying
            above-50-percent vendors, the State agency may compare each
            vendor&apos;s WIC redemptions to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
            Program redemptions for the same period. If more than one WIC State
            agency authorizes a particular vendor, then each State agency must
            obtain and add the WIC redemptions for each State agency that
            authorizes the vendor to derive the total WIC redemptions. If
            Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program redemptions exceed WIC
            redemptions, no further assessment is required since the vendor
            would not be an above-50-percent vendor. For vendors whose WIC
            redemptions exceed their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
            redemptions, or if this comparison of redemptions was not made, the
            State agency must obtain from these vendors a statement of the total
            amount of revenue derived from the sale of foods that could be
            purchased using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
            The State agency must also obtain from these vendors documentation
            (such as tax documents or other verifiable documentation) to support
            the amount of food sales claimed by the vendor. After evaluating the
            documentation received from the vendor, the State agency must
            calculate WIC redemptions as a percent of total food sales and
            classify the vendor as meeting or not meeting the above-50- percent
            criterion. State agencies may use additional methods, if approved by
            FNS.

            instruments. A State agency that elects to exempt non-profit vendors

            vendors that are subject to competitive price criteria and allowable
            reimbursement levels cannot provide the required supplemental foods,

             With prior written approval from FNS, a State agency may use a
            vendor cost containment approach other than a peer group system if
            it meets certain conditions. A State agency that obtains an
            exemption from the peer group requirement still must establish
            competitive pricing criteria for vendor selection and allowable
            reimbursement levels. An exemption from the peer group requirement
            would remain in effect until the State agency no longer meets the
            conditions on which the exemption was based, until FNS revokes the
            exemption, or for three years, whichever occurs first. During the
            period of the exemption, the State agency must provide annually to
            FNS documentation that it either authorizes no above-50-percent
            vendors, or that such vendors&apos; redemptions continue to
            represent less than five percent of total WIC redemptions, depending
            on the terms of the exemption. The conditions for obtaining an
            exemption from the vendor peer group system are as follows:

            year prior to a fiscal year in which the exemption is effective; and
            the State agency demonstrates to FNS that its alternative vendor
            cost containment system would be as effective as a vendor peer group
            system and would not result in higher costs if program participants
            redeem food instruments at vendors that meet the above-50-percent
            criterion rather than at vendors that do not meet this criterion.

             If a State agency elects to authorize any above-50-percent vendors,
            the State agency must submit information, in accordance with
            guidance provided by FNS, to demonstrate that its competitive price
            criteria and allowable reimbursement levels do not result in average
            payments per food instrument to these vendors that are higher than
            average payments per food instrument to comparable vendors that are
            not above-50-percent vendors. To calculate average payments per food
            instrument, the State agency must include either all food
            instruments redeemed by all authorized vendors or a representative
            sample of the redeemed food instruments. The State agency must add
            the redemption amounts for all redeemed food instruments of the same
            type and divide the sum by the number of food instruments of that
            type. If the State 
            <PRTPAGE P='410' />
            agency does not designate food instruments by type, it must
            calculate the average payment for each distinct combination of foods
            prescribed on the food instrument. The State agency may calculate
            average payments per food instrument type for groups of vendors that
            meet the above-50-percent criterion and comparable vendors, or the
            State agency may calculate average payments for each food instrument
            type for each vendor. State agencies with EBT systems must compare
            the average cost of each WIC food purchased by participants at
            above-50-percent vendors with the average cost of each food
            purchased from comparable vendors. If FNS determines, based on its
            review of the information provided by the State agency and any other
            relevant data, that the requirements in this paragraph have been
            met, FNS will certify that the State agency&apos;s competitive price
            criteria and allowable reimbursement levels established for
            above-50-percent vendors do not result in higher average payments
            per food instrument (or higher costs for each WIC food item in EBT
            systems). If the State agency&apos;s methodology for establishing
            competitive price criteria and allowable reimbursement levels fails
            to meet the requirement of this section regarding average food
            instrument payments to above-50-percent vendors, FNS will disapprove
            the State agency&apos;s request to authorize above-50-percent
            vendors. At least every three years following initial certification,
            the State agency must submit information which demonstrates that it
            continues to meet the requirements of this section relative to
            average payments to above-50-percent vendors. FNS may require annual
            updates of selected food instrument redemption data.

             The State agency must enter into written agreements with all
            authorized vendors. The agreements must be for a period not to
            exceed three years. The agreement must be signed by a representative
            who has legal authority to obligate the vendor and a representative
            of the State agency. When the vendor representative is obligating
            more than one vendor, the agreement must specify all vendors covered
            by the agreement. When more than one vendor is specified in the
            agreement, the State agency may add or delete an individual vendor
            without affecting the remaining vendors. The State agency must
            require vendors to reapply at the expiration of their agreements and
            must provide vendors with not less than 15 days advance written
            notice of the expiration of their agreements.

              Food instrument redemption.

          <text>
             The vendor must submit food instruments for redemption in
            accordance with the redemption procedures described in the vendor
            agreement. The vendor may redeem a food instrument only within the
            specified time period. As part of the redemption procedures, the
            State agency may make price adjustments to the purchase price on
            food instruments submitted by the vendor for redemption to ensure
            compliance with the price limitations applicable to the vendor. As
            part of the redemption procedures, the State agency must establish
            and apply limits on the amount of reimbursement allowed for food
            instruments based on a vendor&apos;s peer group and competitive
            price criteria. In setting allowable reimbursement levels, the State
            agency must consider participant access in a geographic area and may
            include a factor to reflect fluctuations in wholesale prices. In
            establishing allowable reimbursement levels for above-50-percent
            vendors the State agency must ensure that reimbursements do not
            result in higher food costs than if participants transacted their
            food instruments at vendors that are not above-50-percent vendors,
            or in higher average payments per food instrument to
            above-50-percent vendors than average payments to comparable
            vendors. The State agency may make price adjustments to the purchase
            price on food instruments submitted by the vendor for redemption to
            ensure compliance with the allowable reimbursement level applicable
            to the vendor. A vendor&apos;s failure to remain price competitive
            is cause for termination of the vendor agreement, even if actual
            payments to the vendor are within the maximum reimbursement amount.
            The State agency may exempt vendors that supply only exempt infant
            formula and/or WIC-eligible medical foods and non-profit
            above-50-percent vendors from the allowable reimbursement limits.

             When the State agency determines the vendor has committed a vendor
            violation that affects the payment to the vendor, the State agency
            will delay payment or establish a claim. The State agency may delay
            payment or establish a claim in the amount of the full purchase
            price of each food instrument or cash-value voucher that contained
            the vendor overcharge or other error. The State agency will provide
            the vendor with an opportunity to justify or correct a vendor
            overcharge or other error. The vendor must pay any claim assessed by
            the State agency. In collecting a claim, the State agency may offset
            the claim against current and subsequent amounts to be paid to the
            vendor. In addition to denying payment or assessing a claim, the
            State agency may sanction the vendor for vendor overcharges or other
            errors in accordance with the State agency&apos;s sanction schedule.

             The State agency must conduct compliance investigations of a
            minimum of five percent of the number of vendors authorized by the
            State agency as of October 1 of each fiscal year. The State agency
            must conduct compliance investigations on all high-risk vendors up
            to the five percent minimum. The State agency may count toward this
            requirement a compliance investigation of a high-risk vendor
            conducted by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. The
            State agency also may count toward this requirement a compliance
            investigation conducted by another WIC State agency provided that
            the State agency implements the option to establish State agency
            sanctions based on mandatory sanctions imposed by the other WIC
            State agency, as specified in paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section.
            A compliance investigation of a high-risk vendor may be considered
            complete when the State agency determines that a sufficient number
            of compliance buys have been conducted to provide evidence of
            program noncompliance, when two compliance buys have been conducted
            in which no program violations are found, or when an inventory audit
            has been completed.

            investigations sufficient to meet the five-percent requirement. A
            compliance investigation of a randomly selected vendor may be
            considered complete when the State agency determines that a
            sufficient number of compliance buys have been conducted to provide

             The State agency must design and implement a system to review food

            limitations and to detect questionable food instruments or
            cash-value vouchers, suspected vendor overcharges, and other errors.
            This review must examine either all or a representative sample of
            the food instruments and cash-value vouchers and may be done either
            before or after the State agency makes payments on the food
            instruments or cash-value vouchers. The review of food instruments
            must include a price comparison or other edit designed to ensure
            compliance with the 
            <PRTPAGE P='417' />
            applicable price limitations and to assist in detecting vendor
            overcharges. For printed food instruments and cash-value vouchers
            the system also must detect the following errors—purchase price
            missing; participant, parent/caretaker, or proxy signature missing;
            vendor identification missing; food instruments or cash-value
            vouchers transacted or redeemed after the specified time periods;
            and, as appropriate, altered purchase price. The State agency must
            take follow-up action within 120 days of detecting any questionable
            food instruments or cash-value vouchers, suspected vendor
            overcharges, and other errors and must implement procedures to
            reduce the number of errors when possible.

            . During each fiscal year, each State agency shall expend, for
            nutrition education activities and breastfeeding promotion and
            support activities, an aggregate amount that is not less than the
            sum of one-sixth of the amount expended by the State agency for
            costs of NSA and an amount equal to its proportionate share of the
            national minimum expenditure for breastfeeding promotion and support
            activities. The amount to be spent on nutrition education shall be
            computed by taking one-sixth of the total fiscal year NSA
            expenditures. The amount to be spent by a State agency on
            breastfeeding promotion and support activities shall be an amount
            that is equal to at least its proportionate share of the national
            minimum breastfeeding promotion expenditure as specified in
            paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The national minimum expenditure
            for breastfeeding promotion and support activities shall be equal to
            $21 multiplied by the number of pregnant and breastfeeding women in
            the Program, based on the average of the last three months for which
            the Department has final data. On October 1, 1996 and each October 1
            thereafter, the $21 will be adjusted annually using the same
            inflation percentage used to determine the national administrative
            grant per person. If the State agency&apos;s total reported
            nutrition education and breastfeeding promotion and support
            expenditures are less than the required amount of expenditures, FNS
            will issue a claim for the difference. The State agency may request
            prior written permission from FNS to spend less than the required
            portions of its NSA grant for either nutrition education or for
            breastfeeding promotion and support activities. FNS will grant such
            permission if the State agency has sufficiently documented that
            other resources, including in-kind resources, will be used to
            conduct these activities at a level commensurate with the
            requirements of this paragraph (c)(1). However, food costs used to
            purchase or rent breast pumps may not be used for this purpose.
            Nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and support,
            costs are limited to activities which are distinct and separate
            efforts to help participants understand the importance of nutrition
            to health. The cost of dietary assessments for the purpose of
            certification, the cost of prescribing and issuing supplemental
            foods, the cost of screening for drug and other harmful substance
            use and making referrals to drug and other harmful substance abuse
            services, and the cost of other health-related screening shall not
            be applied to the expenditure requirement for nutrition education
            and breastfeeding promotion and support activities. The Department
            shall advise State agencies regarding methods for minimizing
            documentation of the nutrition education and breastfeeding promotion
            and support expenditure requirement. Costs to be applied to the
            one-sixth minimum amount required to be spent on nutrition education
            and the target share of funds required to be spent on breastfeeding
            promotion and support include, but need not be limited to—

            established in Agency policy and guidance are allowable only with
            the approval of FNS prior to the capital investment. These
            expenditures include the costs of facilities, equipment (including
            medical equipment), automated data processing (ADP) projects, other
            capital assets, and any repairs that materially increase the value
            or useful life of such assets.

             The State agency may keep funds collected through the recovery of
            claims assessed against vendors, participants, or local agencies.
            Recovered funds include those withheld from a vendor as a result of
            reviews of food instruments prior to payment. Recovered funds may be
            used for either food or NSA costs.

             The funds available for allocation to State agencies for NSA for
            each fiscal year must be sufficient to guarantee a national average
            per participant NSA grant, adjusted for inflation. The amount of the
            national average per participant grant for NSA for any fiscal year
            will be an amount equal to the national average per participant
            grant for NSA issued for the preceding fiscal year, adjusted for
            inflation. The inflation adjustment will be equal to the percentage
            change between two values. The first is the value of the index for
            State and local government purchases, as published by the Bureau of
            Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce, for the 12-month
            period ending June 30 of the second preceding fiscal year. The
            second is the best estimate that is available at the start of the
            fiscal year of the value of such index for the 12-month period
            ending June 30 of the previous fiscal year. Funds for NSA costs will

             For each State agency, FNS will establish, using all available NSA
            funds, an NSA fair share target funding level which is based on each
            State agency&apos;s average monthly participation level for the
            fiscal year for which grants are being calculated, as projected by
            FNS. Each State agency receives an adjustment to account for the
            higher per participant costs associated with small participation
            levels and differential salary levels relative to a national average
            salary level. The formula shall be adjusted to account for these
            cost factors in the following manner: 90 percent of available funds
            shall provide compensation based on rates which are proportionately
            higher for the first 15,000 or fewer participants, as projected by
            FNS, and 10 percent of available funds shall provide compensation
            based on differential salary levels, as determined by FNS.

             For each State agency, FNS will establish a fair share target
            funding level which shall be an amount of funds proportionate to the
            State agency&apos;s share of the national aggregate population of
            persons who are income eligible to participate in the Program based
            on the 185 percent of poverty criterion. The Department will
            determine each State agency&apos;s population of persons
            categorically eligible for WIC which are at or below 185% of
            poverty, through the best available, nationally uniform, indicators
            as determined by the Department. If the Commodity Supplemental Food
            Program (CSFP) also operates in the area served by the WIC State
            agency, the number of participants in such area participating in the
            CSFP but otherwise eligible to participate in the WIC Program, as
            determined by FNS, shall be deducted from the WIC State
            agency&apos;s population of income eligible persons. If the State

             to limit program participation to U.S. citizens, nationals, and
            qualified aliens, FNS will reduce the State agency&apos;s population
            of income eligible persons to reflect the number of aliens the State
            agency declares no longer eligible.

             The Department may adjust the respective amounts of food funds that
            would be allocated to a State agency which is outside the 48
            contiguous states and the District of Columbia when the State agency
            can document that economic conditions result in higher food costs
            for the State agency. Prior to any such adjustment, the State agency
            must demonstrate that it has successfully implemented voluntary cost
            containment measures, such as improved vendor management practices,
            participation in multi-state agency infant formula rebate contracts
            or other cost containment efforts. The Department may use the

             If funds remain available after the allocation of funds under
            paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the funds shall be allocated
            as provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii). First, FNS will calculate
            a target inflation allowance by applying the anticipated rate of
            food cost inflation, as determined by the Department, to the prior
            year grant funding level. Second, FNS will allocate 80 percent of
            the available funds to all State agencies in proportionate shares to
            meet the target inflation allowance. Third, FNS will allocate 20
            percent of the available funds to each State agency which has a
            prior year grant level allocation, as determined in paragraph
            (c)(3)(ii) of this section and adjusted for inflation as determined
            in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), which is still less than its fair
            share target funding level. The amount of funds allocated to each
            State agency shall be based on the difference between its prior year
            grant level allocation plus target inflation funds and the fair
            share funding target level. Each State agency&apos;s difference
            shall be divided by the sum of the differences for all such State
            agencies, to determine the percentage share of the 20 percent of
            available funds each State agency shall receive. In the event a
            State agency declines any of its allocation under either this
            paragraph (c)(3)(iii) or paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
            <PRTPAGE P='432' />
            section, the declined funds shall be reallocated in the percentages
            and manner described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii). Once all State
            agencies receive allocations equal to their full target inflation
            allowance, any remaining funds shall be allocated or reallocated, in
            the manner described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), to those State
            agencies still under their fair share target funding level.

             A State agency may submit a plan to FNS to reduce average food
            costs per participant and to increase participation above the
            FNS-projected level for the State agency. If approved, the State

            participation increase, as applicable. The conversion rate is the
            same as the per participant NSA grant and is determined by dividing
            the State agency&apos;s NSA grant by the FNS-projected participation
            level. The NSA grant used in the calculation equals the initial
            allocation of current year funds plus the operational adjustment
            funding allocated to the State agency for that fiscal year.

             Under the single solicitation system, the State agency&apos;s bid
            solicitation must require the winning bidder to supply and provide a
            rebate on all infant formulas it produces that the State agency
            chooses to issue, except exempt infant formulas. Rebates must also
            be paid on any new infant formulas that are introduced after the
            contract is awarded. The solicitation must require bidders that do
            not produce a soy-based infant formula to subcontract with another
            manufacturer to supply a soy-based infant formula under the
            contract. In this case, the bid solicitation must require that the
            winning bidder pay the State agency a rebate on the soy-based infant
            formula supplied by the subcontractor that is issued by the State
            agency. The bid solicitation must require all rebates (including
            those for soy-based infant formula supplied by a subcontractor) to
            be calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
            All of these infant formulas are called contract brand infant
            formulas.

          <text>
             Under the separate solicitation system, a State agency issues two
            bid solicitations. Any State agency or alliance that served a
            monthly average of more than 100,000 infants during the preceding
            12-month period shall issue separate bid solicitations for
            milk-based and soy-based infant formula. The first solicitation must
            require the winning bidder to supply and provide a rebate on all
            milk-based infant formulas it produces that the State agency chooses
            to issue, except exempt infant formulas. Rebates must also be paid
            on any new milk-based infant formulas that are introduced by the
            manufacturer after the contract is awarded. These infant formulas
            are considered to be contract brand infant formulas. The second bid
            solicitation must require the winning bidder to supply and provide a
            rebate on all soy-based infant formulas it produces that the State
            agency chooses to issue. Rebates must also be paid on any 
            <PRTPAGE P='436' />
            new soy-based infant formulas that are introduced by the
            manufacturer after the contract is awarded. These infant formulas
            are also considered to be contract brand infant formulas.

          <text>
             A State alliance may exist among State agencies if the total number
            of infants served by States participating in the alliance as of
            October 1, 2003, or such subsequent date determined by the Secretary
            for which data is available, does not exceed 100,000. However, a
            State alliance that existed as of July 1, 2004, and serves over
            100,000 infants may exceed this limit to include any State agency
            that served less than 5,000 infants as of October 1, 2003, or such
            subsequent date determined by the Secretary for which data is
            available, and/or any Indian State agency. The bid solicitation must
            identify the composition of the State alliances for the purpose of a
            cost containment measure, and verify that no additional State shall
            be added to the State alliance between the date of the bid
            solicitation and the end of the contract. The Secretary may waive
            these requirements not earlier than 30 days after submitting to the
            Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of
            Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and
            Forestry of the Senate a written report that describes the
            cost-containment and competitive benefits of the proposed waiver.

            for infant formula or the highest monthly rebate (subject to

             The State agency must specify a standardized number of units (e.g.,
            cans) of infant formula by physical form (e.g., concentrated liquid,
            powdered, and ready-to-feed) to be bid upon. The standardized number
            of units must contain the equivalent of the total number of ounces
            by physical form needed to give the maximum allowance to the average
            monthly number of infants using each form. The number of infants
            does not 
            <PRTPAGE P='437' />
            include infant participants who are exclusively breastfed and those
            who are issued exempt infant formula. The average monthly number of
            infant using each physical form must be based on at least 6 months
            of the most recent participation and issuance data. In order to
            calculate the standardized number of units of infant formula by form
            to be bid upon, the average monthly number of infants using each
            physical form is multiplied by the maximum monthly allowable number
            of ounces for each form (as allowed under

            (Table1)), and divided by the corresponding unit size (i.e., number
            of ounces per unit being bid). In order to compare bids, total cost
            is calculated by multiplying this standardized number of units by
            the net price for each physical form. Alternative calculations that
            arrive at a mathematically equivalent result are acceptable.

             Before issuing the bid solicitation, a State agency that elects to

            satisfaction that the weighted average retail prices for different
            brands of infant formula in the State vary by 5 percent or less. The
            weighted average retail price must take into account the prices
            charged for each type and physical form of infant formula by
            authorized vendors or, if a State agency elects, it may include
            stores that do not participate in the WIC program in the State. The
            State agency must also base calculations on the proportion of each

            based on the data provided to bidders pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)

             The rebate for each type and form of all other contract brand
            infant formulas must be calculated by multiplying the percentage
            discount by the manufacturer&apos;s lowest national wholesale price
            per unit, as of the date of the bid opening, for a full truckload of
            the other contract brand infant formula. The percentage discount
            used for each of the other contract brand infant formulas depends on
            the physical form of the infant formula. For example, if the 
            <PRTPAGE P='438' />
            percentage discount provided for the primary contract brand powdered
            infant formula is 80 percent of its wholesale price, the same
            percentage discount must be applied to all other contract brand
            powdered infant formulas. The rebate for any types or forms of
            contract brand infant formulas that are introduced during the
            contract period must be calculated using the wholesale prices of
            these new contract brand infant formulas at the time the infant
            formulas are approved for issuance by the State agency.

             In establishing the potential food cost savings under each system,
            the State agency must take into consideration in its estimate of
            savings any inflation factors which would affect the amount of
            savings over the life of the contract. Further, the State agency
            must not subtract any loss of payments which would occur under the
            terms of a current contract as a result of any State agency action
            to be effective after expiration of the contract.

             The State agency must deduct from the food cost savings projected

            administration costs associated with developing and implementing—but

            anticipated costs for modifying its automated data processing system
            or components of its food delivery system(s), and of training
            participants, local agencies, vendors, and licensed health care
            professionals on the purpose and procedures of the new system. For
            contracts of two years or less, such costs must be proportionately
            distributed over at least a two year period. The State agency must
            not deduct any costs associated with procurement. The State agency
            must itemize and justify all nutrition services and administration
            cost adjustments as necessary and reasonable for the development and
            implementation of each system.

             The State agency must calculate the food costs savings and deduct
            the appropriate nutrition services and administration costs for each
            system for which bids were received. The State agency must implement
            the single-supplier competitive system, unless its comparative cost
            analysis shows that, over the length of the contract stipulated in
            the bid solicitation, an alternative cost containment system offers
            savings at least equal to, or greater than, those under the
            competitive single-supplier system. If the comparative cost analysis
            permits selection of the alternative cost containment system and the
            State agency wishes to implement that system, it must first submit a
            State Plan amendment with the calculations and supporting
            documentation for this cost analysis to FNS for approval. Only after
            the calculations are approved by FNS may the State agency award the
            contract or contracts under the alternative cost containment system.

             A State agency may request a postponement of the requirement to
            continuously operate a cost containment system for infant formula
            that has been implemented in accordance with this section. However,
            a State agency may only request a postponement when it has taken
            timely and responsible action to implement a cost containment system
            before its current system expires but has been unable to do so due
            to procurement delays, disputes with FNS concerning cost containment
            issues during the State Plan approval process or other circumstances
            beyond its control. The written postponement request must be
            submitted to FNS before the expiration of the current system. The
            postponement period may be no longer than 120 days. If a
            postponement is granted, the State agency may extend, renew or
            otherwise continue an existing system during the period of the
            postponement.

             If FNS determines that the number of State agencies making the
            request provided for in paragraph (l)(2) of this section does not
            comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,
            FNS shall, in consultation with such State agencies, divide such
            State agencies into more than one group and solicit bids for each
            group. These groups of State agencies are referred to as “bid
            groups.” In determining the size and composition of the bid groups,
            FNS will, to the extent practicable, take into account the need to
            maximize the number of potential bidders so as to increase
            competition among infant formula manufacturers and the similarities
            in the State agencies&apos; procurement and contract requirements
            (as provided by the State agencies in accordance with paragraphs
            (l)(2)(ii), (l)(2)(iii), and (l)(2)(iv) of this section). FNS
            reserves the right to exclude a State agency from the national bid
            solicitation and selection process if FNS determines that the State
            agency&apos;s procurement requirements or contractual requirements
            are so dissimilar from those of the other State agencies in any bid
            group that the State agency&apos;s inclusion in the bid group could
            adversely affect the bids.

             For each bid group formed pursuant to paragraphs (l)(2) and (l)(3)
            of this section, FNS will use for soliciting bids the competitive
            bidding procurement procedures of the State agency in the group with
            the highest infant participation. To the extent not inconsistent
            with the requirements of this paragraph (l), FNS will use that set
            of procedures in soliciting the bids for that 
            <PRTPAGE P='442' />
            bid group of State agencies. FNS will notify each State agency in
            the bid group of the choice and provide them each a copy of the
            procurement procedures of the chosen State agency. Each State agency
            must provide FNS a written statement, signed by a responsible State
            agency official, by certified mail, return receipt requested or by
            hand delivery with evidence of receipt stating whether that State
            agency is legally authorized to award an infant formula cost
            containment contract pursuant to that set of procedures within 10
            days of the receipt of the notification. If the State agency
            determines it is not legally authorized to award an infant formula
            cost containment contract pursuant to those procedures, that State
            agency may not continue in that round of the national bid

             The duration of the infant formula cost containment contracts for

            State agencies. The term will be for a period of not less than 2
            years, unless the law applicable to a State agency regarding the
            duration of infant formula cost containment contracts is more
            restrictive than this paragraph (l)(5)(iii). In such cases, the term
            of the contract for only that State agency will be for one year,
            with the option provided to the State agency to extend the contract
            for a specified number of additional years (to be determined by FNS

            containment contracts awarded by the State agencies within a bid

             FNS may disqualify a State agency&apos;s participation under the
            Program, in whole or in part, or take such remedies as may be legal
            and appropriate, whenever FNS determines that the State agency

            Federal-State Agreement, or in

            agency in writing of the disqualification together with the
            effective date. A State agency shall disqualify a local agency by
            written notice whenever it is determined by FNS or the State agency
            that the local agency has failed to comply with the requirements of
            the Program.

            or the local agency may disqualify the local agency or restrict its
            participation in the Program under the same conditions. The two
            parties shall agree upon the conditions of disqualification,
            including the effective date thereof, and, in the case of partial
            disqualification, the portion to be disqualified.

            of the noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the State
            agency prior to disqualification, and the State agency shall do the

             A final audit is not a required part of the grant closeout and
            should not be needed unless there are problems with the grant that
            require attention. If FNS considers a final audit to be necessary,
            it shall so inform OIG. OIG will be resonsible for ensuring that
            necessary final audits are performed and for any necessary
            coordination with other Federal cognizant audit agencies or the
            State or local auditors. Audits performed in accordance with

             may serve as final audits providing such audits meet the needs of
            requesting agencies. If the grant is closed out without the audit,
            FNS reserves the right to disallow and recover an appropriate amount
            after fully considering any recommended disallowances resulting from
            an audit which may be conducted later.

             FNS and each State agency shall establish a management evaluation
            system in order to assess the accomplishment of Program objectives
            as provided under this part, FNS guidelines, instructions, and the
            Federal-State agreement with the Department. FNS will provide
            assistance to States in discharging this responsibility, establish
            standards and procedures to determine how well the objectives of
            this part are being accomplished, and implement sanction procedures
            as warranted by State Program performance.

             The State agency must submit a corrective action plan, including
            implementation timeframes, within 60 days of receipt of an FNS
            management evaluation report containing a finding that the State
            agency did not comply with program requirements. If FNS determines
            through a management evaluation or other means that during a fiscal
            year the State agency has failed, without good cause, to demonstrate
            efficient and effective administration of its program, or has failed
            to comply with its corrective action plan, or any other requirements
            contained in this part or the State Plan, FNS may withhold an amount
            up to 100 percent of the State agency&apos;s nutrition services and
            administration funds for that year.

            reports, program or financial analysis, monitoring, audit, or
            otherwise, that any Program funds provided to a State agency for
            supplemental foods or nutrition services and administration purposes
            were, through State or local agency negligence or fraud, misused or
            otherwise diverted from Program purposes, a formal claim will be

             If the State agency determines that program benefits have been
            obtained or disposed of improperly as the result of a participant
            violation, the State agency must establish a claim against the
            participant for the full value of such benefits. For all claims, the
            State agency must issue a letter demanding repayment. If full
            restitution is not made or a repayment schedule is not agreed on
            within 30 days of receipt of the letter, the State agency must take
            additional collection actions until restitution is made or a
            repayment schedule is agreed on, unless the State agency determines
            that further collection actions would not be cost-effective. The
            State agency must establish standards, based on a cost benefit
            analysis, for determining when collection actions are no longer
            cost-effective. At the time the State agency 
            <PRTPAGE P='452' />
            issues the demand letter, the State agency must advise the
            participant of the procedures to follow to obtain a fair hearing
            pursuant to 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            hardship to provide restitution by performing in-kind services

            authority, without recourse to FNS, regarding the settlement and
            satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising
            out of procurements entered into in connection with the Program.
            This includes, but is not limited to, disputes, claims, protests of
            award, source evaluation, or other matters of a contractual nature.
            Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to such
            local, State or Federal authority as may have proper jurisdiction.
