          The purpose of the regulations in this part is to prevent the
          dissemination of plant pests into the United States, or interstate, by
          regulating the movement of plant pests into or through the United
          States, or interstate, and the movement of means of conveyance, earth,
          stone and quarry products, garbage, and certain other products and
          articles into or through the United States, or from any Territory or
          possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the
          continental United States. The Deputy Administrator shall employ
          procedures to carry out this purpose which will impose a minimum of
          impediment to foreign commerce and travel whenever practicable,
          consistent with proper precaution against plant pest dissemination.
          The same policy is to be applied in the case of interstate commerce
          and travel.

            of such movement. The inspector may follow administrative
            instructions containing procedures prescribed for certain
            situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him from
            administratively approved methods known to be effective. The

            his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans of the owner to
            remove the means of conveyance from the territorial limits of the
            United States within the extended period, the inability of the
            contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other
            reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be

            compliance with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from
            the territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in
            another country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or
            other articles or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be
            unloaded from the means of conveyance except as authorized by the

            opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of
            the means of conveyance which contain or contained or were
            contaminated by the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the

            inspector, the aircraft shall be subject to the same disinfestation
            requirements and other safeguards immediately upon arrival in the
            United States. Customs officers shall be notified as required in
            paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

             The owner of a means of conveyance required to be fumigated
            pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent operator to
            apply the fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. The owner
            shall understand that if certain fumigants are used they may result
            in residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for use
            as food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as
            ascertains that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human
            consumption. It should also be understood by the owner that
            emergency measures prescribed by the inspector to safeguard against
            dissemination of infestation may have adverse effects on certain
            products and articles, and that the acceptance of fumigation as a
            requirement is an alternative to the immediate removal of the
            infested means of conveyance and any products and articles thereon,
            from the territorial limits of the United States. Products or
            articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments thereof, which
            may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial measures and may
            be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the means of
            conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of the
            remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be
            done without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions
            authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of
            effective remedial measures.

             Whenever, in the opinion of the inspector, it is necessary, as a
            safeguard in order to prevent the dissemination of plant pests into
            the United States, or interstate, seals may be applied to openings,
            packages, or articles requiring the security provided by such seals.
            The words “openings, packages, or articles” shall include any form
            of container, shelf, bin, compartment, or other opening, package, or
            article which the inspector may have occasion to seal in lieu of
            more drastic action or otherwise, as a safeguard against plant pest
            dissemination. The seals may be automatic metal seals or labels or
            tags and will be provided by the Plant Protection and Quarantine
            Programs. When they consist of a label or tag, they will be printed
            in black ink on yellow paper and read substantially as follows:
            “Warning! The opening, package, or article to which this seal is
            affixed is sealed under authority of law. This seal is not to be
            broken while within the territorial limits of the United States
            except by, or under instructions of, an inspector.”

             Only persons resident in the United States may apply for permits to
            move plant pests into the United States from any place outside
            thereof. Persons resident in the United States proposing such
            movement into the United States, or any person proposing movement
            through the United States, of any plant pests shall first make
            application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to
            the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided
            therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or by
            submitting in the form of a letter or other written communication
            the following information insofar as is known to the applicant, for
            each kind of pest for which a permit is requested: (1) Scientific
            name of the pest, (2) stage, (3) quantity, (4) origin, (5)
            destination, (6) whether the pest is established in the State,
            Territory or other jurisdiction of destination in the United States,
            (7) method of shipment, (8) proposed port of first arrival in the
            United States, (9) approximate date of arrival, (10) number of
            parcels expected to be moved, (11) intended use, (12) measures to be
            employed to prevent danger of plant pest dissemination, and (13)
            method of final disposition. In addition, if host materials must
            necessarily accompany the plant pests, the application shall show
            the name of the host materials and the reasons it is necessary for
            them to accompany the plant pests. Applications for permits to move
            plant pests through the United States should

             Persons contemplating the shipment of plant pests to places outside
            the United States should make prior arrangements directly, or
            through the recipient, with the country of destination for the
            receipt of the plant pests into the country of destination. Many
            countries have laws governing the movement of plant pests into those

          The Deputy Administrator, having considered an application for permit

          . If the application is denied, the applicant shall be furnished the
          reasons therefor. If the application is approved, the Deputy
          Administrator shall issue the permit including any conditions which,
          in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, are necessary to prevent
          dissemination of plant pests into the United States or interstate.
          Such conditions may include requirements for inspection of the
          premises where the plant pests are to be handled, after their movement
          under the permits, to determine whether the facilities thereat are
          adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination and the conditions of the
          permit are otherwise being observed. Permits authorizing movement of
          plant pests through the United States will include shipping
          instructions as to routing, labelling, and similar requirements as
          conditions of the permits. Any applicable conditions prescribed in
          administrative instructions may be incorporated in a written permit by
          citation, but shall be applicable whether or not so cited. The Deputy
          Administrator may, prior to the issuance of the permit, require the
          applicant to agree in writing to the conditions under which the plant
          pests will be safeguarded. The permits may be issued in a prescribed
          form or in letter form, or a combination thereof. A permit without
          conditions may be issued orally.

          must be free of soil, except when the Deputy Administrator approves in
          the permit the movement of soil with the plant pest. Subject to this
          exception, only approved packing materials are to be employed in the
          shipment of plant pests. Approved packing materials for the movement
          of plant pests under this part will be prescribed in administrative
          instructions or approved in specific cases by the Deputy
          Administrator. Such actions will be coordinated with and may

          packing and packaging of any materials for movements covered by the
          postal laws and regulations. All containers shall be stoutly

            Cargo shipments of plant pests so moved may be refused entry unless

          movement must be observed. The inspector will insure that the movement
          is handled in accordance with the terms of the permit. If it is
          necessary to move the plant pest to another place for clearance, the
          owner will be responsible for all costs incidental to such forwarding.
          Pending forwarding, the inspector will specify and supervise the
          application of safeguards against danger of plant pest dissemination
          and may retain custody of the pests until forwarded.

            pest dissemination and shall be appropriately labeled as to

            is to send to the foreign shipper. The quantity of mailing labels

            postal and the plant quarantine officials that the movement is
            authorized under the conditions specified in this permit.
            Importations arriving by mail without labels will be subject to
            refusal of entry into the United States, or interstate movement, by
            the inspector unless treated, at the expense of the owner, in a
            manner to remove danger of plant pest dissemination. The Deputy
            Administrator may issue mailing labels for movement into or through
            the United States from any place outside thereof, or from any
            Territory or possession into or through any other Territory or
            possession of the continental United States, of earth other than
            soil when the movement might otherwise be impeded because of the
            similarity to soil subject to this section.

             Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in
            writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the
            person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to
            comply with this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the
            cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed
            in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose
            compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in
            writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the
            cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons
            upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement
            was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the
            Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the
            reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any
            conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a
            hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. This administrative
            remedy must be exhausted before a person can file suit in court
            challenging the cancellation of a compliance agreement.
