             This part outlines the policies and procedures for making and
            processing direct loans and grants for water and waste projects. The
            Rural Utilities Service (RUS) shall cooperate fully with State and
            local agencies in making loans and grants to assure maximum support
            to the State strategy for rural development. Agency officials and
            their staffs shall maintain coordination and liaison with State
            agency and substate planning districts.

             The income data used in this part to determine median household
            income must be that which most accurately reflects the income of the
            service area. The median household income of the service area and
            the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State will be
            determined from income data from the most recent decennial census of
            the United States. If there is reason to believe that the census
            data is not an accurate representation of the median household
            income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented
            and the applicant may furnish, or the Agency may obtain, additional
            information regarding such median household income. Information will
            consist of reliable data from local, regional, State or Federal
            sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source.
            The nonmetropolitan median household income of the State may only be
            updated on a national basis by the RUS National Office. This will be
            done only when median household income data for the same year for
            all Bureau of the Census areas is available from the Bureau of the
            Census or other reliable sources. Bureau of the Census areas would
            include areas such as: Counties, County Subdivisions, Cities, Towns,
            Townships, Boroughs, and other places.

             Should the Agency determine that inequities exist within the

            Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability,
            adequacy or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of
            existing systems that were developed under different financing,
            rates, terms or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.

             Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income
            availability and be in accordance with State law. If State law only
            permits principal plus interest (P&amp;I) type bonds, annual or
            semiannual payments will be used. Insofar as practical monthly
            payments will be scheduled one full month following the date of loan

            with another lender, the RUS payments of principal and interest
            should approximate amortized installments.

            outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority lien
            obtainable will be taken if the approval official determines that
            the loan is adequately secured.

            more than one type is available, the other lender may take one type
            of security with RUS taking another type. For projects utilizing

            another lender, RUS will obtain at least a parity position with the
            other lender. A parity position is to ensure that with joint
            security, in the event of default, each lender will be affected on a
            proportionate basis. A parity position will conform with the
            following unless an exception is granted by the approval official:

             The use of a trustee or other similar paying agent by the other
            lender in a joint financing arrangement is acceptable to RUS. A
            trustee or other similar paying agent will not normally be used for
            the RUS portion of the funding unless required to comply with State
            law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other
            similar paying agent on projects that include RUS funds must be
            clearly specified by written agreement and approved by the State
            program official and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). RUS
            must be able to deal directly with the borrower to enforce the
            provisions of loan and grant agreements and perform necessary
            servicing actions.

            formulas by which the Administrator of the RUS allocates program
            funds to the States. (The term “State” means any of the States of
            the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or

             The formulas in this part are used to allocate program loan and
            grant funds to Rural Development State offices so that the overall
            mission of the Agency can be carried out. Considerations used when
            developing the formulas include enabling legislation, congressional
            direction, and administration policies. Allocation formulas ensure
            that program resources are available on an equal basis to all
            eligible individuals and organizations.

             Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic State factor as a part
            of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas
            take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a
            particular program and through a normalization and weighting process
            for each of the criteria calculate the basic State factor (SF). The
            data sources used for each criteria are believed to be the most
            current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the
            criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative
            value to the importance of each of the criteria.

             A formula based on a proportional amount of previous year
            allocation used to maintain program continuity by preventing large
            fluctuations in individual State allocations. The transition formula
            limits allocation shifts to any particular State in the event of
            changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic criteria,
            or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula first
            checks whether the current year&apos;s basic formula allocation is
            within the transition range (plus or minus 20 percentage points of
            the proportional amount of the previous year&apos;s BFA). The
            formula follows:

             If the current year&apos;s State BFA is not within the transition
            range in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the State formula
            allocation is changed to the amount of the transition range limit
            closest to the BFA amount. After having performed this transition
            adjustment for each State, the sum of the funds allocated to all
            States will differ from the amount of funds available for BFA. This
            difference, whether a positive or negative amount, is distributed to
            all States receiving a formula allocation by multiplying the
            difference by the SF. The end result is the transition formula
            allocation. The transition range will not exceed 40% (plus or minus
            20%), but when a smaller range is used it will be stated in the
            individual program section.

            grant. The notice of intent must be published in a newspaper of
            general circulation in the proposed area to be served.

             Applicants should inform the general public regarding the
            development of any proposed project. Any applicant not required to
            obtain authorization by vote of its membership or by public
            referendum, to incur the obligations of the proposed loan or grant,
            must hold at least one public information meeting. The public
            meeting must be held not later than loan or grant approval. The
            meeting must give the citizenry an opportunity to become acquainted
            with the proposed project and to comment on such items as economic
            and environmental impacts, service area, alternatives to the
            project, or any other issue identified by Agency. To the extent
            possible, this meeting should cover items necessary to satisfy all
            public information meeting requirements for the proposed project. To
            minimize duplication of public notices and public involvement, the
            applicant shall, where possible, coordinate and integrate the public
            involvement activities of the environmental review process into this
            requirement. The applicant will be required, at least 10 days prior
            to the meeting, to publish a notice of the meeting in a newspaper of
            general circulation in the service area, to post a public notice at
            the applicant&apos;s principal office, and to notify the Agency. The
            applicant will provide the Agency a copy of the published notice and
            minutes of the public meeting. A public meeting is not normally
            required for subsequent loans or grants which are needed to complete
            the financing of a project.

             Applicants are encouraged to contact the Agency processing office
            early in the planning stages of their project. Agency personnel are
            available to provide general advice and assistance regarding RUS
            programs, other funding sources, and types of systems or
            improvements appropriate for the applicants needs. The Agency can
            also provide access to technical assistance and other information
            resources for other project development issues such as public
            information, income surveys, developing rate schedules, system
            operation and maintenance, and environmental compliance
            requirements. Throughout the planning, application processing and
            construction of the project, Agency personnel will work closely and
            cooperatively with the applicant and their representatives, other
            State and Federal agencies and technical assistance providers.

            Construction),” assist applicants as needed in completing SF 424.2,
            and in filing a request for intergovernmental review. Federally
            recognized Indian tribes are exempt from intergovernmental review.
            The processing office will explain eligibility requirements and meet
            with the applicant whenever necessary to discuss application
            processing.

            contract basis to another system or entity, similar wholesale system
            cost will be used in determining the amount of grant needed to
            achieve a reasonable wholesale user cost.

             When annual cost to the applicant for delivery of service is
            subsidized by either the state, commonwealth, or territory, and
            uniform flat user charges regardless of usage are imposed for
            similar classes of service throughout the service area, the Agency
            may proceed with a grant in an amount necessary to reduce such
            delivery cost to a reasonable level.

             The user charges should be reasonable and produce enough revenue to
            provide for all costs of the facility after the project is complete.
            The planned revenue should be sufficient to provide for all debt
            service, debt reserve, operation and maintenance, and, if
            appropriate, additional revenue for facility replacement of
            short-lived assets without building a substantial surplus.
            Ordinarily, the total debt service reserve will be equal to one
            average annual loan installment which will accumulate at the rate of
            one-tenth of the total each year.

             The amount of cash contributions required will be set by the
            applicant and concurred in by the approval official. Contributions
            should be an amount high enough to indicate sincere interest on the
            part of the potential user, but not so high as to preclude service
            to low income families. Contributions ordinarily should be an amount
            approximating one year&apos;s minimum user fee, and shall be paid in
            full before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever
            occurs first. Once economic feasibility is ascertained based on a
            demonstration of potential user cash contributions, the
            contribution, membership fee or other fees that may be imposed are
            not a loan requirement under this section. A new user cash
            contribution is not required when:

             For all loans exceeding $500,000, where funds can be borrowed at
            reasonable interest rates on an interim basis from commercial
            sources for the construction period, such interim financing may be
            obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of
            RUS loan funds. However, the approval official may make an exception
            when interim 
            <PRTPAGE P='309' />
            financing is cost prohibitive or unavailable. Guidance on informing
            the private lender of RUS&apos;s commitment is available from the
            Agency. When interim commercial financing is used, the application
            will be processed, including obtaining construction bids, to the
            stage where the RUS loan would normally be closed, that is
            immediately prior to the start of construction. The RUS loan should
            be closed as soon as possible after the disbursal of all interim
            funds.

             Applicants will provide coverage for all persons who have access to

             If there is a significant reduction in project cost, the

            funds will be based on revised project costs and current number of
            users, however, other factors including RUS regulations used at the
            time of loan or grant approval will remain the same. Obligated loan
            or grant funds not needed to complete the proposed project will be

            such cases, applicable forms, the letter of conditions, and other
            items will be revised.

             Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on

            the Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a
            basis other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary
            adjustments so that annual financial statements are presented on the
            accrual basis.

            In addition, the audits are also to be performed in accordance with
            various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars. The type of
            audit each borrower is required to submit will be designated by RUS.
            Further guidance on preparing an acceptable audit can be obtained

            separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State
            and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be
            done in conjunction with those audits. Audits shall be annual unless

            covered by the audit. OMB Circulars are available in any USDA/RUS

             When RUS loans are secured by the general obligation of the public
            body or tax assessments which total 100 percent of the debt service
            requirements, the State program official may authorize an annual
            audit to substitute for other management reports if the audit is
            received within 150 days following the period covered by the audit.

             Facilities financed by the Agency must undergo an environmental
            impact analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy
            Act and RUS procedures. Facility planning and design must not only
            be responsive to the owner&apos;s needs but must consider the
            environmental consequences of the proposed project. Facility design
            shall incorporate and integrate, where practicable, mitigation
            measures that avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
            Environmental reviews serve as a means of assessing environmental
            impacts of project proposals, rather than justifying decisions
            already made. Applicants may not take any action on a project
            proposal that will have an adverse environmental impact or limit the
            choice of reasonable project alternatives being reviewed prior to
            the completion of the Agency&apos;s environmental review.

             All procurement transactions, regardless of whether by sealed bids

            <PRTPAGE P='320' />

            practices between firms; organizational conflicts of interest; and
            unnecessary experience and bonding requirements. In specifying
            materials, the owner and its consultant will consider all materials
            normally suitable for the project commensurate with sound
            engineering practices and project requirements. The Agency shall
            consider fully any recommendation made by the owner concerning the
            technical design and choice of materials to be used for a facility.
            If the Agency determines that a design or material, other than those
            that were recommended should be considered by including them in the
            procurement process as an acceptable design or material in the water
            or waste disposal facility, the Agency shall provide such owner with
            a comprehensive justification for such a determination. The
            justification will be documented in writing.

            approach would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and

            of services, supplies or other property, costing in the aggregate
            not more than $100,000. If small purchase procedures are used for a
            procurement, written price or rate quotations shall be requested
            from at least three qualified sources.

             In competitive negotiations, proposals are requested from a number
            of sources and the Request for Proposal is publicized. Negotiations
            are normally conducted with more than one of the sources submitting
            offers. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are not
            appropriate for the use of formal advertising and where discussions
            and bargaining with a view to reaching agreement on the technical
            quality, price, other terms of the proposed contract and

            preliminary approving opinion of bond counsel (or local counsel if
            no bond counsel is involved) if a final unqualified opinion cannot

            during the advance of funds, such as litigation resulting from the

             A single instrument providing for amortized installments which
            follows Form RD 440-22 as closely as possible. The full amount of
            the loan must show on the face of the instrument, and there must be
            provisions for entering the date and amount of each advance on the
            reverse or an attachment. When principal payments are deferred, the
            instrument will show that “interest only” is due on interest-only
            installment dates, rather than specific dollar amounts. The payment
            period including the “interest only” installment cannot exceed 40
            years, the useful life of the facility, or State statute
            limitations, whichever occurs first. The amortized installment,
            computed as follows, will be shown as due on installment dates
            thereafter.

            principal plus interest accrued on the principal balance. For bonds
            with semiannual interest and annual principal, the interest is
            calculated by multiplying the principal balance times the interest
            rate and dividing this figure by two. Principal installments are to
            be scheduled so that total combined interest and principal payments
            closely approximate amortized payments.

          similar temporary debt instrument may be used. The debt instrument
          will provide for multiple advances of Agency funds and will be for the
          full amount of the Agency loan. The instrument will be prepared by
          bond counsel, or local counsel if bond counsel is not involved, and
          approved by the State program official and OGC. At the same time the
          Agency delivers the last advance, the borrower will deliver the
          permanent bond instrument and the canceled temporary instrument will
          be returned to the borrower. The approved debt instrument will show at
          least the following:

             Bonds will normally be dated as of the day of delivery. However,

            closing is the date of delivery of the bonds or the date of delivery
            of the first bond when utilizing serial bonds, regardless of the
            date of delivery of the funds. The date of delivery will be stated
            in the bond if different from the date of the bond. In all cases,
            interest will accrue from the date of delivery of the funds.

             Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond
            issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the
            contractual provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing
            requirement and any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect
            precludes the Agency from requiring refinancing before the final
            maturity date, it represents a violation of the statutory
            refinancing requirement; therefore, it is disallowed. No loan
            documents shall include a provision of defeasance.

             When security includes special assessment to be collected over the
            life of the loan, the instrument should address the method of
            applying any payments made before they are due. It may be desirable
            for such payments to be distributed over remaining payments due,
            rather than 
            <PRTPAGE P='329' />
            to be applied in accordance with normal procedures governing extra
            payments, so that the account does not become delinquent.
