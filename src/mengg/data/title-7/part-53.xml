        <P>
          When an official grader, supervisor, or other responsible employee of
          the Branch has evidence of misgrading, or of incorrect certification
          or other incorrect determination or identification as to the class,
          grade, other quality, or compliance of livestock, he shall report the
          matter to his immediate supervisor. The supervisor will investigate 
          <PRTPAGE P='13' />
          the matter and, if he deems advisable, will report it to the owner or
          his agent. The supervisor shall take appropriate action to correct
          errors found in the determination or identification of class, grade or
          other quality or compliance of livestock if the livestock is still
          owned by the person who owned them when, and are still located at the
          establishment where, the incorrect service was rendered and if such
          service was rendered by a grader under the jurisdiction of such
          supervisor, and the supervisor shall take adequate measures to prevent
          the recurrence of such errors.
