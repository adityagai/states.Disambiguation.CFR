          the Secretary, pursuant to this subpart, determines to be appropriate.
          Handlers shall share expenses on the basis of a fiscal period. Each
          handler&apos;s share of such expenses shall be proportionate to the
          ratio between the total quantity of onions handled by him as the first
          handler thereof during a fiscal period and the quantity of onions
          handled by all handlers as first handlers thereof during such fiscal
          period.

          For purposes of this part any person who operates an established
          packing house within the production area with commonly accepted
          adequate facilities for grading and packing onions for market, and who
          customarily buys onions from producers for grading, packing, and
          marketing shall be recorded by the committee as a registered handler.
          Any other person who wishes to be listed as a registered handler may
          make application for registration on forms furnished by the committee.
          If such applicant has facilities available to him that are determined
          by the committee to be adequate for grading and packing onions for
          market, and he assumes responsibility for inspection of onions handled
          by him, and for assessments thereon, he may be approved and recorded
          as a registered handler. If the committee determines from the
          available information that the applicant is not entitled to be
          registered with the committee, he shall be so informed by written
          notice stating the reason for denial of his application. Any
          registration of a handler pursuant to this section may be canceled by
          the committee under circumstances which would have justified denial of
          his application. Any handler whose registration has been canceled
          shall be so informed by written notice thereof stating the reason
          therefor. The committee shall also notify producers of each such
          cancellation of handler registration through committee bulletins or
          published notice in local newspapers of general distribution, or both.

          onions for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to
          determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and
          regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee

          requirements and regulations applicable to handling of onions in
          special outlets and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or
          Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and
          subsequent certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to,
          and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the
          committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the date of the
          succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a Certificate rescinded
          or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration
          of his disqualification.

          5 through July 15 shall comply with paragraphs (c) or (d) or (e) of
