          The USNA may charge a fee for the use of the facility or grounds for
          purposes of commercial photography or cinematography as specified in 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            §

          . Facilities and grounds are available for use for commercial
          photography or cinematography at the discretion of the USNA Director.
          Requests for use should be made a minimum of two weeks in advance of
          the required date. The USNA will charge for supervision costs at the
          rate of $40.00 per hour per security officer, in addition to the fees
          listed below. The USNA Director may waive fees for photography or
          cinematography conducted for the purpose of disseminating information
          to the public regarding the USNA and its mission or for the purpose of
          First Amendment activity. The USNA will charge a non-refundable
          application fee of $30 for commercial photography or cinematography
          activities that use models, sets or props that are not part of the
          natural, cultural resources, or administrative facilities features of
          the site; take place where members of the public are generally not
          allowed; or take place at a location where additional administrative
          costs are likely. If the application is approved and fees will be
          incurred, the application fee will be applied to the total fee due. No
          other credits will be given for the application fee. Fee payments for
          use of facilities or grounds or for commercial photography and
          cinematography must be made in advance of services being rendered.
          These payments are to be made in the form of a check or money order.

             Unless provided otherwise, all payments due under this subpart must
            be made by cash, check, or money order (in U.S. funds). Checks and
            money orders for payment of any fees imposed under this part are to
            be made payable, in U.S. funds, to the “U.S. National Arboretum.”
            Upon request, the USNA shall provide receipts to requesters for
            their records or billing purposes. If the USNA enters into an
            agreement to allow USNA visitors and users to make payment in the
            form of a credit card, USNA visitors and users who are assessed user
            fees may pay those fees with a credit card subject to the terms and
            conditions of such agreement.
