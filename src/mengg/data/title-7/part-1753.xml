             The standard RUS Telecommunications Loan Documents contain
            provisions regarding procurement of materials and equipment and
            construction of telecommunications facilities by telecommunications
            borrowers. This part implements certain of the provisions by setting
            forth requirements and procedures. Borrowers shall follow these
            requirements and procedures whenever using loan funds to purchase
            materials and equipment or perform construction, unless they have
            received the Administrator&apos;s written approval to do otherwise.

             The typical procedure followed in constructing a project financed
            by an RUS loan begins with the prospective borrower obtaining the
            necessary preloan engineering and developing a complete loan
            application, including an LD (See

            is approved and all prerequisites to advance of funds are satisfied,
            the borrower may proceed with the purchase and installation of

             To obtain RUS approval of the force account method for major
            construction the borrower must demonstrate its ability to perform
            major construction based on past force account construction which
            fully met RUS construction standards and was as cost-effective as
            contract construction in the area. If the borrower has no record of
            past performance to support its request, but has adequate equipment
            and experienced personnel to perform the proposed construction, RUS
            may approve a small trial project. The requirements and procedures
            for force account construction are presented in subparts D, E, G,

            could meet the bid requirements, but was not invited to bid. RUS

             The borrower may request permission to negotiate with a single
            supplier for additional central offices to standardize equipment on
            a system basis. RUS approval to negotiate must be obtained before
            release of the plans and specifications to the supplier. Except for
            remote switching terminals associated with an existing central
            office, RUS will not approve negotiation with a non-domestic
            manufacturer for the purpose of standardization because such a
            purchase does not meet the RE Act “Buy American” provisions.

            (iii) The Licensee shall take reasonable steps to protect the
            confidentiality of the Licensed Software and shall not decompile or
            reverse assemble all or any part of the Licensed Software to
            generate source code. The Licensee shall not make the Licensed
            Software available to any person except on a need to know basis. The
            obligations of the Licensee hereunder shall not extend to any
            information or data relating to the Licensed Software which is now
            available to the general public or becomes available by reason of

            in-house training and operating, maintaining, and administering the
            System provided under this Contract. In such reproduction, the

            or authorize the activation of, the subsisting nonactivated program
            instruction steps in the Licensed Software. In this event Licensee
            shall pay any additional Right-To-Use Fee(s) agreed to by Licensee
            and Licensor.

            (vi) In the event the Licensor develops significant improvements to
            the Licensed Software, the Licensor may market the improvements as a

            Fee.

          <P>
            (A) Changes to the Licensed Software which are necessary to preserve
            or restore service. Licensee shall use all reasonable efforts to
            contact Licensor before making any such changes. If the Licensor is
            unable to make the necessary changes promptly to the Licensed
            Software to preserve or restore service, then the Licensee may make
            only such changes to the Licensed Software as are necessary to
            preserve or restore service. In such event, Licensee shall promptly
            notify Licensor of the changes made by Licensee.
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) Changes made by the Licensee to its own database; and

          <P>
            (C) Changes made by the Licensee in connection with the exercise of
            its rights under section (2)(xi).
          </P>
          <P>
            (viii) Within thirty (30) days after written notice that a program
            or a release thereof has been discontinued and is no longer required
            for the operation of the System and the Licensor has furnished the
            Licensee with a new program that is fully satisfactory to the
            Licensee, the Licensee agrees to return the original and all copies
            of the discontinued program and specified related documents. If such
            return is impossible or impractical, the Licensee shall destroy said
            program and documents and provide the Licensor with a written notice
            of such destruction.
          </P>
          <P>
            (ix) The Licensor warrants to the Licensee that any Software
            licensed under this Software License shall function for a period of
            five (5) years from the warranty start date defined in the Contract
            in accordance with the Specifications and any written or printed
            technical material provided by the Licensor to explain the operation
            of the Licensed Software and aid in its use. The Licensor shall
            correct all deficiencies within thirty (30) days from the date of
            receipt by the Licensor of written notice of such deficiencies from
            the Licensee. An extension of this thirty (30) day period may be
            allowed only if agreed upon by the Licensee and RUS. It shall be the
            Licensor&apos;s obligation to insert and thoroughly test, at no
            charge to the Licensee, any software amendment or alteration
            provided to satisfy the obligations of this section (2)(ix). If a
            deficiency is detected or a correction made within the final ninety
            (90) days of the warranty, the warranty shall be extended to a date
            ninety (90) days after the deficiency has been corrected.
          </P>
          <P>
            (x) The Licensor shall hold harmless and indemnify the Licensee from
            any and all claims, suits, and proceedings for the infringement of
            any patent, copyright, trademark, or violation of trade secrets
            covering any Licensed Software used with the System, except for
            items of the Licensee&apos;s design or selection. If the
            Licensee&apos;s use of the Licensed Software is enjoined, the
            Licensor shall promptly, at its own expense, place the Licensee in a
            position where it is able to use the System in accordance with the
            Specifications, whether by:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) Modifying the Licensed Software or portion thereof so that it no
            longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent,
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) Replacing the Licensed Software with noninfringing equivalent
            software,
          </P>
          <P>
            (C) Obtaining for the Licensee a license or other right to use, or
          </P>
          <P>
            (D) Such other actions as may be required. This shall be in addition
            to any other rights or claims which the Licensee may have. The
            Licensor shall, at its own expense, (and the 
            <PRTPAGE P='427' />
            Licensee agrees to permit the Licensor to do so) defend any suits
            which may be instituted by any party against the Licensee for
            alleged infringement of patents, copyright, trademark, or violation
            of trade secrets relative to the Licensor&apos;s performance
            hereunder. Either party shall notify the other promptly of any such
            claims, and the Licensee shall give to the Licensor full authority
            and opportunity to settle such claims, and shall reasonably
            cooperate with the Licensor in obtaining information relative to
            such claims.
          </P>
          <P>
            (xi) In the event the Licensor becomes unwilling or unable to
            furnish support required by the Contract for the Licensed Software,
            the Licensor shall, upon written request of the Licensee, provide
            with the greatest possible dispatch all Licensed Software back-up
            documentation including proprietary information other than agreed
            excluded documentation. In this event, (1) the Licensee shall be
            permitted full use of all Licensed Software and documentation as
            long as the System is operational and (2) the Licensee may modify,
            or have modified, the Licensed Software for feature enhancement or
            proper equipment operation and becomes the owner of such
            modifications for all purposes, including patenting, copywriting,
            sale, or license thereof. Agreed excluded documentation is Licensed
            Software back-up documentation described in the first sentence of
            this section (2)(xi) which (A) is proprietary information of a third
            party, (B) was specifically described at the pre-bid technical
            session and individually identified in an attachment to the Bid, and
            (C) RUS and the Licensee agree, before bids are opened, may be
            excluded from the requirements of this section (2)(xi). In the event
            the Licensor furnishes agreed excluded documentation and the
            Licensee exercises its rights under this section (2)(xi), the
            Licensor shall use its best efforts to provide such agreed excluded
            information to the Licensee, or obtain continuing support agreements
            from the parties retaining legal rights to the excluded
            documentation. Licensor agrees that certain Licensed Software cannot
            be excluded from the requirements of this section (2)(xi) including,
            but not limited to, software, the absence or improper operation of
            which would significantly impair the operation of the System, would
            significantly impair the ability of the Licensee to generate
            revenue, or would pose a risk to RUS loan security.
          </P>
          <P>
            (xii) A breach of this License by the Licensor is a breach of the
            Contract. Therefore, the remedies specified in the Contract shall
            apply.
          </P>
          <P>
            (xiii) The Licensee shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
            written notice from the Licensor to correct any breach of this
            License. Damages payable by the Licensee for its breach of this
            License shall not exceed the total Contract price. The Licensor
            shall not terminate this License unless:
          </P>
          <P>
            (A) The Licensor has given RUS sixty (60) days notice before
            termination; and
          </P>
          <P>
            (B) RUS agrees with the Licensor that termination is the only method
            available to prevent significant harm to the Licensor from
            additional Licensee defaults.

            routine line extensions and placement of subscriber drops. See

            temporarily with general funds, RUS may establish, on a case by case
            basis, a work order fund for specific construction projects. The

             Upon completion and prior to closeout, minor construction must be
            inspected and certified to be in compliance with RUS construction
            standards, to be reasonable in cost, and to meet applicable codes.
            The certification is made by an experienced telephone engineer who
            is either licensed in the state where the inspection will be
            performed, or is a borrower&apos;s staff engineer, who meets the
            requirements of the “employee in charge” of force account
            engineering as described in subpart B of this part. The GFR will
            periodically audit the inspection of minor construction to ensure
            integrity of the procedure. RUS borrowers with less than 2000
            subscribers may use the above procedure or have construction
            inspection performed by the GFR.

             It is RUS policy that, as borrowers gain in experience and
            maturity, the advice and assistance rendered by RUS shall
            progressively diminish. Prior to approval of a loan, RUS may
            nominate certain borrowers to fulfill the responsibilities for
            administration and construction of projects financed with RUS loans.
            Borrowers who accept this nomination will be known as “certification
            borrowers,” and the program in which they participate will be known
            as the “certification program.”
