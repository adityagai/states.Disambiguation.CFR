           the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) requires the Secretary of
          Agriculture to determine the essential uses of natural gas, and to
          certify to the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory
          Commission (FERC) the natural gas requirements, expressed either as
          volumes or percentages of use, of persons, or classes thereof, for
          essential agricultural uses in order to meet requirements of full food
          and fiber production. This rule covers establishments performing
          functions classed as essential agricultural uses whose natural gas
          supplies are distributed through the interstate pipeline systems even
          though such establishments may receive such gas directly from an
          intrastate pipeline or local distribution company. The rule provides
          to the Secretary of Energy (for purposes of
