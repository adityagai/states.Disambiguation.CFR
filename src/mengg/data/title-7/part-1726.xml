          The policies, procedures and requirements included in this part are
          intended to implement provisions of the standard form of loan
          documents between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and its electric
          borrowers. Unless prior written approval is received from RUS,
          borrowers are required to comply with RUS policies and procedures as a
          condition to RUS providing loans, loan guarantees, or reimbursement of
          general funds for the construction and improvement of electric
          facilities. Requirements relating to RUS approval of plans and
          specifications, duties and responsibilities of the engineer and
          architect, and engineering and architectural services contracts, are
          contained in other RUS regulations. The terms “RUS form”, “RUS
          standard form”, “RUS specification”, “and RUS bulletin” have the same
          meanings as the terms “REA form”, “REA standard form”, “REA
          specification”, “and REA bulletin”, respectively, unless otherwise
          noted.

          Each borrower is responsible for the planning, design, construction,
          operation and maintenance of its electric system. RUS, as a secured
          lender, has a legitimate interest in accomplishing RUS&apos;s
          programmatic objectives, and in assuring that the costs of
          construction, materials, and equipment are reasonable and economical
          and that the property securing the loans is constructed adequately to
          serve the purposes for which it is intended.

          The requirements of this part apply to the procurement of materials
          and equipment for use by electric borrowers in their electric systems
          and to the construction of their electric systems if such materials,
          equipment, and construction are financed, in whole or in part, with
          loans made or guaranteed by RUS, including reimbursable 
          <PRTPAGE P='245' />
          projects. In order for general fund expenditures for procurement or
          construction to be eligible for reimbursement from loan funds, the
          borrower must comply with the procedures required by this part. In the
          case of jointly owned projects, RUS will determine on a case by case
          basis the applicability of the requirements of this part.

            dealing with a prospective bidder, the borrower may solicit
            information from that bidder or from other parties with firsthand
            experience regarding the firm&apos;s capabilities and experience. It
            is also important to consider the firm&apos;s performance record,
            safety record, and similar factors in determining whether to include
            that firm on the QBL, since the borrower may not evaluate these
            factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder.

             The standard loan agreement between RUS and the borrowers provides
            that, in accordance with applicable RUS regulations in this chapter,
            the borrower shall use standard forms of contracts promulgated by
            RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services, and
            architectural services financed by a loan made or guaranteed by RUS.
            This part implements these provisions of the RUS loan agreement.
            Subparts A through H and J of this part prescribe when and how
            borrowers are required to use RUS standard forms of contracts in
            procurement and construction. Subpart I of this part prescribes the
            procedures that RUS follows in promulgating standard contract forms
            and identifies those 
            <PRTPAGE P='248' />
            contract forms that borrowers are required to use for procurement
            and construction.

          Certain RUS contract forms contain a provision concerning payment of
          interest on overdue accounts. Prior to issuing the invitation to
          bidders, the borrower must insert an interest rate equal to the lowest
          “Prime Rate” listed in the “Money Rates” section of the Wall Street
          Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued. If no prime rate
          is published on that date, the last such rate published prior to that
          date must be used. The rate must not, however, exceed the maximum rate
          allowed by any applicable state law.

             During the early stages of generating plant design or project
            design, RUS will, in consultation with the borrower and its
            consulting engineer, identify the specific contracts which require
            RUS approval based on information supplied in 
            <PRTPAGE P='253' />
            the plant design manual. The following are typical contracts for
            each type of generating project which will require RUS approval.
            Although engineering services are not covered by this part, they are
            listed in this paragraph (d) to emphasize that RUS approval is
            required for all major generating station engineering service
            contracts in accordance with applicable RUS rules. For types of
            projects not shown, such as nuclear and alternate energy projects,
            RUS will identify the specific contracts which will require RUS
            approval on a case by case basis.

             Where the borrower encounters reluctance among manufacturers,
            suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on transmission
            equipment or generation equipment, materials or construction,
            modifications may be made in the RUS standard form of contracts.
            These modifications, if applicable, may include, as an alternative
            to the standard form, provisions for adjusting a base price either
            upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes
            between the time of the bid and the time the work is performed or
            materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large
            number of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the
            Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower (acting through its
            engineer, if applicable) will select the indexes for the particular
            item to be used in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers&apos;
            corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are
            reported in the BLS&apos;s monthly publications entitled “Employment
            and Earnings” and “Producer Prices and Price Indexes.” These
            publications may be ordered through the Superintendent of Documents,
            U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or any of the
            BLS regional offices.

          This section applies only to transmission equipment purchases and
          generation contracts. Where the borrower anticipates difficulty in
          obtaining responsive bids on RUS standard contract forms due to a lack
          of limitation with respect to special and consequential damages, and
          where the borrower believes that such a modification will encourage
          competition through the receipt of an alternative bid which limits the
          bidder&apos;s liability for special and consequential damages, the
          borrower may make the following approved phrase modifications in the

          Prior approved contract modification related to alternative bid

        <P>
          When construction is to be performed over an extended period of time,
          but large quantities of material are to be purchased by the contractor
          at the beginning of the project (e.g., cable for URD installations),
          the borrower may allow alternative bids providing for payment to the
          contractor of 90 percent of the cost of such materials within 30 days
          of delivery of those materials at the job site. The borrower will
          retain the right to award the contract with or without the alternative
          payment provision, however, the contract still must be awarded on the
          basis of the lowest evaluated responsive bid for the alternative
          accepted.

            inspection and testing at a time mutually agreeable to the borrower,
            architect or engineer, and the contractor. Within thirty (30) days
            after completion of the inspection and testing, the borrower (acting
            through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will prepare a
            report of the inspection and testing, obtain a copy of the report
            from its architect or engineer, and submit a copy to the contractor.
            This report must include a detailed description of the methods of
            conducting the test(s), observed data, comparison of guaranteed and
            actual performance, and recommendations concerning acceptance. The
            borrower will obtain from its architect or engineer a written
            certification stating that the equipment has been installed, placed
            in satisfactory operation and tested, and meets the contract
            requirements. Where more than one-hundred and eighty (180) days have
            elapsed since the delivery of the equipment and the equipment has
            not been installed or tested, the contract may be closed out upon
            certification by its architect or engineer that the equipment has
            been inspected and appears to be in accordance with the contract
            requirements.

             If equipment is supplied under a construction contract, the
            borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) will perform
            the final inspection and testing of equipment as appropriate for the
            specific equipment. The borrower (acting through its engineer, if
            applicable) will schedule such inspection and testing at a time
            mutually agreeable to the borrower, its engineer, and the
            contractor. Within thirty (30) days after completion of the
            inspection and testing, the borrower (acting through its engineer,
            if applicable) will prepare a report of the inspection and testing,
            obtain a copy of the report from its engineer, and submit a copy to
            the contractor. This report must include a detailed description of
            the methods of conducting the test(s), observed data, comparison of
            guaranteed and actual performance, and recommendations concerning
            acceptance. The borrower will obtain 
            <PRTPAGE P='267' />
            from the engineer a written certification stating that the equipment
            has been installed, placed in satisfactory operation and tested, and
            meets the contract requirements. Where more than one-hundred and
            eighty (180) days have elapsed since the delivery of the equipment
            and the equipment has not been installed or tested, the contract may
            be closed out upon certification by the engineer that the equipment
            has been inspected and appears to be in accordance with the contract
            requirements.
