            Prior to the beginning of each calendar year, AMS shall release, to
            manufacturers that are required to report, the times and dates that
            reports are due. For the applicable products, the report shall be
            submitted by electronic means specified by AMS and shall indicate
            the name, address, plant location(s), quantities sold, total sales
            dollars, dollars per pound, and the moisture content where
            applicable. Each sale shall be reported for the time period when the
            transaction is completed, i.e. the product is “shipped out” and
            title transfer occurs. Each sale shall be reported either f.o.b.
            plant if the product is “shipped out” from the plant or f.o.b.
            storage facility location if the product is “shipped out” from a
            storage facility. In calculating the total dollars received and
            dollars per pound, the reporting entity shall neither add
            transportation charges incurred at the time the product is “shipped
            out” or after the product is “shipped out” nor deduct transportation
            charges incurred before the product is “shipped out.” In calculating
            the total dollars received and dollars per pound, the reporting
            entity shall not deduct brokerage fees or clearing charges paid by
            the manufacturer.
