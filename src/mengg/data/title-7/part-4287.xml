          its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The Loan Note
          Guarantee is unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is
          occasioned by violation of usury laws, use of loan funds for
          unauthorized purposes, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the
          required security interest regardless of the time at which the Agency
          acquires knowledge of the foregoing. This responsibility includes but
          is not limited to the collection of payments, obtaining compliance
          with the covenants and provisions in the Loan Agreement, obtaining and
          analyzing financial statements, checking on payment of taxes and
          insurance premiums, and maintaining liens on collateral.

             The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate
            a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the
            guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written
            agreement among these parties. The Agency must be notified by the
            lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the change. If any of
            the guaranteed portion has been purchased by the Agency, then the
            Agency will affirm or reject interest rate change proposals in
            writing. The Agency will concur in such interest-rate changes only
            when it is demonstrated to the Agency that the change is a more
            viable alternative than initiating or proceeding with liquidation of
            the loan or continuing with the loan in its present state.

             The lender must notify the Agency when a borrower is 30 days past
            due on a payment or is otherwise in default of the Loan Agreement.
            Form FmHA 1980-44, “Guaranteed Loan Borrower Default Status,” will
            be used and the lender will continue to submit this form bimonthly
            until such time as the loan is no longer in default. If a monetary
            default exceeds 60 days, the lender will arrange a meeting with the
            Agency and the borrower to resolve the problem.

        <P>
          Protective advances are advances made by the lender for the purpose of
          preserving and protecting the collateral where the debtor has failed
          to, will not, or cannot meet its obligations. Sound judgment must be
          exercised in determining that the protective advance preserves
          collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.
          Protective advances will not be made in lieu of additional loans.

            market value and potential liquidation value. In order to formulate
            a liquidation plan which maximizes recovery, collateral must be
            evaluated for the release of hazardous substances, petroleum
            products, or other environmental hazards which may adversely impact
            the market value of the collateral. The appraisal shall consider

            the Agency and the lender.

          In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the
          lender after the collateral is liquidated, unless otherwise designated
          as a future recovery or after settlement and compromise of all parties
          has been completed. The Agency will have the right to recover losses

            in this section, is completed, a final report of loss must be

            not guarantee interest beyond this 30-day period other than for the
            period of time it takes the Agency to process the loss claim. Before
            approval by the Agency of any final loss report, the lender must
            account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition
            of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information

             If a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
            United States Code for a reorganization (but not Chapter 13) and all
            or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender will
            request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the
            accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. Only one
            estimated loss payment is allowed during the reorganization. All
            subsequent claims of the lender during reorganization will be
            considered revisions to the initial estimated loss. A revised
            estimated loss payment may be processed by the Agency, at its
            option, in accordance with any court-approved changes in the
            reorganization plan. Once the reorganization plan has been
            completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the
            documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the
            estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal
            and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court-ordered
            interest-rate reduction under the terms of the reorganization plan.

             Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business contemplating
            an ongoing business rather than a termination and dissolution of the
            business where legal protection is afforded to the business as
            defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently,
            expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11 reorganization can
            never be liquidation expenses unless the proceeding becomes a
            Chapter 11 liquidation. If the proceeding should become a
            Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be
            deducted from proceeds of collateral as provided in the
            Lender&apos;s Agreement. Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the
            borrower&apos;s assets. If, and when, liquidation of the
            borrower&apos;s assets under Chapter 7 is conducted by the
            bankruptcy trustee, then the lender cannot claim expenses.
