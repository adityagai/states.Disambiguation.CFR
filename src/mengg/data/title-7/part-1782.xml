        <P>
          Mergers and consolidations will be processed the same as a transfer
          and assumption, although approvals by the Agency will give
          consideration to the differences under the applicable law regarding
          the type of transaction under consideration and the unique facts
          involved in each transaction. Mergers occur when two or more entities
          combine in such a manner that only one remains in existence.
          Consolidations occur when two or more entities combine to form a new
          consolidated entity, and the original entities cease to exist. In both
          mergers and consolidations, the surviving or emerging entity acquires
          the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity or entities that
          ceased to exist.

             Typically, debt settlement will be accomplished through
            compromise/adjustment, charge-off, or cancellation. Any debt
            remaining after the security has been liquidated, by sale or
            transfer, will be cancelled if there are no other assets from which
            to collect the debt. The servicing official will proceed with advice
            from OGC and the National Office, as required.

             If, after making a loan or a grant, the Administrator determines
            that the circumstances under which the loan or grant was made have
            sufficiently changed to make the project or activity for which the
            loan or grant was made available no longer appropriate, the
            Administrator may allow the borrower or grantee to use property
            (real and personal) purchased or improved with the loan or grant
            funds, or proceeds from the sale of property (real and personal)
            purchased with such funds, for another project or activity that:

             If the new use of the property is under the authority of another
            USDA Agency Administrator, the other Administrator will be consulted
            on whether the new use will meet the criteria of the other program.
            Since the new project or activity must be carried out in the same
            area as the original project or activity, a new rural area
            determination will not be necessary.

             Borrowers and grantees that wish to use the proceeds for other
            purposes may make their request through the appropriate Rural
            Development State Office. Permission to use this option will be
            exercised on a case-by-case-basis on applications submitted through
            the State Office to the Administrator for consideration. If the
            proposal is approved, the Administrator will issue a memorandum to
            the State Director outlining the conditions necessary to complete
            the transaction.
