             This subpart establishes RUS policies and procedures for mergers of
            electric borrowers. These policies and procedures are intended to
            provide borrowers with the flexibility to negotiate and enter into
            mergers that offer advantages to the borrowers and to rural
            communities, and adequately protect the integrity and credit quality
            of RUS loans and loan guarantees.

            ) (RE Act), RUS encourages electric borrowers to consider mergers
            when such action is likely to contribute, in the long-term, to
            greater operating efficiency and financial soundness. Borrowers are
            specifically encouraged to explore mergers that are likely to
            enhance the ability of the successor to provide reliable electric
            service at reasonable cost to RE Act beneficiaries.

             Pursuant to the loan documents and RUS regulations, certain mergers

             Since RUS must take action in order to advance funds and otherwise
            conduct business with a successor, RUS encourages borrowers to
            consult RUS early in the process regardless of whether RUS approval
            of the merger is required. RUS will provide technical assistance and
            guidance to borrowers to help expedite the processing of their
            requests and to help resolve potential problems early in the
            process.

          RUS recognizes that short-term financial stresses can follow even the
          most beneficial mergers. To help stabilize electric rates, enhance the
          credit quality of outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the
          Government, and otherwise ease the transition period before the
          long-term efficiencies and economies of a merger can be realized, RUS
          may approve one or more types of transitional assistance to a
          successor under the conditions set forth in this part.

             RUS loans are generally processed in chronological order based on
            the date the complete application is received in the regional or
            division office. At the borrower&apos;s request, RUS may offer loan
            processing priority for the first loan to a successor, provided that
            the loan is approved by RUS not later than 5 years after the
            effective date of the merger. In considering the request, the
            Administrator will take into account, among other factors, the
            amount of the loan application, whether there is a significant
            backlog in pending loan applications, the impact that loan priority
            would have on the backlog, the savings and efficiencies to be
            realized from the merger and the relative importance of loan
            priority to facilitating the merger. The Administrator may, in his
            or her sole discretion, grant or decline to grant priority, or grant
            priority for a limited amount of the loan application while
            deferring for later consideration the remainder of the application.

             For any subsequent loans approved during those 5 years, RUS may
            offer loan processing priority. In reviewing requests for loan
            processing priority on subsequent loans, RUS will consider the loan
            authority for the fiscal year, the borrower&apos;s projected cash
            flows, its electric rates and rate disparity, and the likely
            mitigation effects of priority loan processing.

             RUS generally requires that an applicant for a municipal rate loan
            obtain a portion of its debt financing from a supplemental source
            without an RUS guarantee. See 
            <aref type='CFR'>

            . RUS will, at the borrower&apos;s request, waive the requirement to
            obtain supplemental financing for the first RUS loan approved after
            the effective date if that first loan is a municipal rate loan whose
            loan period does not exceed 2 years, and the loan is approved by RUS
            not later than 5 years after the effective date. For any subsequent
            loans approved during these 5 years, or if the borrower requests a
            loan period longer than 2 years, RUS may, subject to the
            availability of loan funds, waive or reduce the amount of
            supplemental financing required. In reviewing requests to reduce or
            waive supplemental financing on subsequent loans or on loans with a
            loan period longer than 2 years, RUS will consider the differences
            in interest rates between RUS and supplemental loans and the impacts
            of this difference on the borrower&apos;s projected cash flows and
            its electric rates and rate disparity. If significant differences
            would result, the waiver will be granted.

             RUS makes and guarantees loans to borrowers to bring electric
            service to persons in rural areas. RUS requires, as a condition to
            making or guaranteeing any loans to power supply borrowers, that the
            borrower enter into RUS wholesale power contracts with its several
            members and assign and pledge such contracts as security for the
            repayment of loans made or guaranteed by RUS and for other loans
            which, pursuant to the RE Act, RUS has permitted to be secured
            pursuant to the RUS mortgage. The RUS wholesale power contract

             RUS recognizes the need of state regulatory authorities for
            documents, information and records for use in connection with an
            application for rate approval and will consider any reasonable

             RUS makes and guarantees loans to borrowers to bring electric
            service to persons in rural areas. To accomplish this objective, RUS
            normally requires, as a condition to making or guaranteeing any
            loans to an electric borrower, that the borrower execute and deliver
            the RUS documents in the form prescribed by RUS. The RUS mortgage
            secures repayment of the loans made or guaranteed by RUS and other
            loans which, pursuant to the RE Act, RUS has permitted to be secured
            pursuant to the RUS mortgage. The Administrator relies upon the RUS
            mortgage together with other RUS documents to find and certify, as
            required by

             The loan contract and mortgage between the Rural Utilities Service
            (RUS) and electric borrowers imposes certain restrictions and
            controls on the borrowers and gives RUS (and other co-mortgagees in
            the case of the mortgage) the right to approve or disapprove certain
            actions contemplated by the borrowers. Certain of these controls and
            approval rights are referred to informally as “operational controls”
            because they pertain to decisions or actions with respect to the
            operation of the borrowers&apos; electric systems. The approval
            authority granted to RUS by the loan contract or mortgage regarding
            each decision or action subject to controls is often stated in
            broad, unlimited terms. This subpart lists the main operational
            controls affecting borrowers and establishes for each area of
            control the circumstances under which RUS approval of a decision or
            action by a borrower is either required or not required. In some
            cases, only the general principles or general circumstances
            pertaining to RUS approval or control are presented in this subpart,
            while the details regarding the circumstances and requirements of
            RUS approval or control are set forth in other RUS regulations.
            Since this subpart addresses only the main operational controls,
            failure to address a control or approval right in this subpart in no
            way invalidates such controls or rights established by the loan
            contract, mortgage, other agreements between a borrower and RUS, and
            RUS regulations.

             Upon written notice to a borrower, RUS may amend or annul the

            other RUS regulations if the borrower is in violation of any
            provision of its loan documents or any other agreement with RUS, or
            if RUS determines that loan security and/or repayment is threatened.

            waiver of approval of said decisions and actions made by previous
            written notice, but may not by such notice extend its authority to
            approve decisions and actions by borrowers beyond the authority

             RUS electric borrowers are encouraged to utilize their own funds to
            participate in the economic development of rural areas, provided
            that such activity does not in any way put government funds at risk
            or impair a borrower&apos;s ability to repay its indebtedness to RUS
            and other lenders. In considering whether to make loans,
            investments, or guarantees, borrowers are expected to act in
            accordance with prudent business practices and in conformity with
            the laws of the jurisdictions in which they serve. RUS assumes that
            borrowers will use the latitude afforded them by

            infrastructure projects (such as water and waste systems, garbage

            providing technical, financial, and managerial assistance) and other
            activities to promote business development and economic
            diversification in rural communities. Nonetheless, RUS believes that
            borrowers should continue to give primary consideration to safety
            and liquidity in the management of their funds.

             The average revenue per kWh for residential service received by the

            during the same period for all residential consumers located in the
            state or states served by the borrower. This criterion applies only
            to distribution borrowers and does not apply to power supply
            borrowers. If a borrower serves customers in more than one state,
            the state average revenue per kWh will be based on a weighted
            average using the kWh sales 
            <PRTPAGE P='150' />

             At the request of the borrower, the Administrator in his or her
            sole discretion may decide to exclude up to the amount of net
            profits or margins earned on the borrower&apos;s investments, loans
            and guarantees during the past 10 calendar years, if the
            Administrator determines that such exclusion will not increase loan
            security risks. The borrower must provide documentation satisfactory
            to the Administrator as to the current status of its investments,
            loans and guarantees and the net profits earned during the past 10
            years. Any exclusion approved by the Administrator may or may not
            reduce the level of investments, loans and guarantees to or below
            the 15 percent level. If such exclusion does not reduce the level to
            or below the 15 percent level, RUS will notify the borrower in
            writing that it must reduce or restructure its investments, loans
            and guarantees to a level of not more than 15 percent of total
            utility plant. If the borrower does not come within the 15 percent
            level within a reasonable period of time determined by the
            Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the
            borrower was notified of the required action, then, upon written
            notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan
            contract and mortgage.

            borrower&apos;s mortgage with respect to the issuance of additional
            debt or the refinancing or refunding of debt. If RUS approval is not
            required under such terms of the mortgage itself, a lien
            accommodation is not required. If the loan contract or other
            agreement between the borrower and RUS requires RUS approval with
            respect to the issuance of debt or making additions to or extensions
            of the borrower&apos;s system, such required approvals do not by
            themselves result in the need for a lien accommodation.

            adequate security for RUS&apos;s loans, and the objectives of the
            Rural Electrification Act (RE Act), it is the policy of RUS to
            provide effective and timely assistance to borrowers in obtaining
            financing from other lenders by sharing RUS&apos;s lien on a
            borrower&apos;s assets in order to finance electric facilities,
            equipment and systems, and certain other types of community
            infrastructure. In certain circumstances, RUS may facilitate the
            financing of such assets by subordinating its lien on specific
            assets financed by other lenders.

          payment since issuance of the loan. For example, given a $5 million
          loan, with a maturity of 5 years and equal principal payments of $1
          million due on the anniversary date of the loan, the weighted average
          life would be: (.2)(1 year) + (.2)(2 years) + (.2)(3 years) + (.2)(4
          years) + (.2)(5 years) = .2 years + .4 years + .6 years + .8 years +
          1.0 years = 3.0 years. If instead the loan had a balloon payment of $5
          million at the end of 5 years, the weighted average life would be: ($5
          million/$5 million)(5 years) = 5 years.

             Loan terms and conditions and the loan agreement between the
            borrower and the lender are subject to RUS approval. However, RUS
            will usually waive its right of approval for distribution borrowers
            that meet the conditions for advance approval of a lien
            accommodation or subordination set forth in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            </aref>
            . RUS may also waive its right of approval in other cases.
            RUS&apos;s decision to waive its right of approval will depend on
            the adequacy of security for RUS&apos;s loans, the current and
            projected financial strength of the borrower and its ability to meet
            its financial obligations, RUS&apos;s familiarity with the lender
            and its lending practices, whether the transaction is ordinary or
            unusual, and the uncertainty and credit risks involved in the
            transaction.

            criteria of this paragraph, except applications from borrowers in

            approve them once RUS is satisfied that the requirements of this
            paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section have been met. The

             RUS encourages borrowers to consider investing in financially sound
            projects that are likely to have a positive effect on economic
            development and employment in rural areas. In addition to the
            guidance set forth in 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            , RUS recommends that such investments be made through a subsidiary
            of the borrower in order to clearly separate the financial risks and
            the revenues and costs of the rural development enterprise from
            those of the borrower&apos;s electric utility business. This should
            reduce credit risks to the borrower&apos;s primary business, and
            minimize the possibility of undisclosed cross subsidization of the
            rural development enterprise by electric rate payers.

             It is recommended that borrowers consult with RUS staff before
            submitting their applications to determine whether they will likely
            qualify for advance approval or normal review, and to obtain answers
            to any questions about the information and documents required for
            the application.

             The Administrator will not settle any debt or claim unless the
            Administrator has determined that the borrower is unable to meet its
            financial obligations under its loan documents according to the
            terms of those documents, or that the borrower will not be able to
            meet said obligations sometime within the period of 24 months
            following the month the borrower submits its application for debt
            settlement to RUS, and, in either case, such default is likely to
            continue indefinitely. The determination of a borrower&apos;s
            ability to meet its financial obligations will be based on analyses
            and documentation by RUS of the borrower&apos;s historical, current,
            and projected costs, revenues, cash flows, assets, opportunities to
            reduce costs and/or increase revenues, and other factors that may be
            relevant on a case by case basis.
