             The Secretary, at his or her discretion, shall verify the
            information reported by importers to CBP to determine if additional
            money is due the Board or an amount is due to an importer based on
            the quantity imported and the milk solids content per unit. In the
            case of money due to an importer from the Board, the Board will
            issue payment promptly to the importer. In the case of money due
            from the importer to the Board, the Secretary will send an invoice
            for payment directly to the importer. The remittance will be due to
            the Secretary upon receipt of the invoice. The Secretary will
            promptly forward such payments received to the Board.
