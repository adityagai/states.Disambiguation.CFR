             This class of policymakings and rulemakings seeks to establish
            programmatic approaches to animal and plant health issues. Actions
            in this class typically involve the agency, an entire program, or a
            substantial program component and are characterized by their broad
            scope (often global or nationwide) and potential effect (impacting a
            wide range of environmental quality values or indicators, whether or
            not affected individuals or systems may be completely identified at
            the time). Ordinarily, new or untried methodologies, strategies, or
            techniques to deal with pervasive threats to animal and plant health
            are the subjects of this class of actions. Alternative means of
            dealing with those threats usually have not been well developed.

             This class of APHIS actions may involve the agency as a whole or an
            entire program, but generally is related to a more discrete program
            component and is characterized by its limited scope (particular
            sites, species, or activities) and potential effect (impacting
            relatively few environmental values or systems). Individuals and
            systems that may be affected can be identified. Methodologies,
            strategies, and techniques employed to deal with the issues at hand
            are seldom new or untested. Alternative means of dealing with those
            issues are well established. Mitigation measures are generally
            available and have been successfully employed. Actions in this class
            include:

             This class of APHIS actions shares many of the same
            characteristics—particularly in terms of the extent of program
            involvement, as well as the scope, effect of, and the availability
            of alternatives to proposed actions—as the class of actions that
            normally requires environmental assessments but not necessarily
            environmental impact statements. The major difference is that the
            means through which adverse environmental impacts may be avoided or
            minimized have actually been built right into the actions
            themselves. The efficacy of this approach generally has been
            established through testing and/or monitoring. The Department of
            Agriculture has also promulgated a listing of categorical exclusions
            that are applicable to all agencies within the department unless
            their procedures provide otherwise. Those categorical exclusions,
            codified at

          Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact APHIS program
          officials to determine what types of environmental analyses or
          documentation, if any, need to be prepared. NEPA documents will

          and will become part of the administrative record.
