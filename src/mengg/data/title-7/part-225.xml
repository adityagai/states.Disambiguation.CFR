             FNSRO shall conduct data on the need for Program and State

            the level of State administrative funding paid or payable to the
            State agency under paragraph (b) of this section to reflect changes
            in the size of the State&apos;s Program as compared to that
            estimated in its management and administration plan. The data shall
            be based on approved Program participation levels and shall be
            collected during the period of Program operations. As soon as
            possible following this data collection, payment of any additional
            administrative funds owed shall be made to the State agency. The
            payment may reflect adjustments made to the level of State
            administrative funding based on the information collected during the
            funding assessment. However, FNS shall not decrease the amount of a
            State&apos;s administrative funds as a result of this assessment
            unless the State failed to make reasonable efforts to administer the
            Program as proposed in its management and administration plan or the
            State incurred unnecessary expenses.

            year-round service to the community which it proposes to serve under

            It is a residential camp; it proposes to provide a food service for
            the children of migrant workers; a failure to do so would deny the
            Program to an area in which poor economic conditions exist; a
            significant number of needy children will not otherwise have
            reasonable access to the Program; or it proposes to serve an area
            affected by an unanticipated school closure during the period from
            October through April (or at any time of the year in an area with a

             Each applicant must submit a statement of nondiscrimination in its
            policy for serving meals to children. The statement must consist of
            an assurance that all children are served the same meals and that
            there is no discrimination in the course of the food service. A
            school sponsor must submit the policy statement only once, with the
            initial application to participate as a sponsor. However, if there
            is a substantive change in the school&apos;s free and reduced price
            policy, a revised policy statement must be provided at the State
            agency&apos;s request. In addition to the policy of
            service/nondiscrimination statement described in paragraph (c)(3) of
            this section, all applicants except camps 
            <PRTPAGE P='146' />
            must include a statement that the meals served are free at all
            sites.

            served at a site and is not a standing order for a specific number
            of meals at that site. When the number of children attending is
            below the site&apos;s approved level, the sponsor shall adjust meal
            orders with the objective of serving only one meal per child as
            required under

             Prior to the beginning of Program operations, each State agency
            shall make available training in all necessary areas of Program
            administration to sponsor personnel, food service management company
            representatives, auditors, and health inspectors who will
            participate in the Program in that State. Prior to Program
            operations, the State agency shall ensure that the sponsor&apos;s
            supervisory personnel responsible for the food service receive
            training in all necessary areas of Program administration and
            operations. This training shall reflect the fact that individual
            sponsors or groups of sponsors require different levels and areas of
            Program training. State agencies are encouraged to utilize in such
            training, and in the training of site personnel, sponsor personnel
            who have previously participated in the Program. Training should be
            made available at convenient locations. State agencies are not
            required to conduct this training for sponsors operating the Program
            during unanticipated school

             At their discretion, State agencies may make start-up payments to
            sponsors which have executed Program agreements. Start-up payments
            shall not be made more than two months before the sponsor is
            scheduled to begin food service operations and shall not exceed 20
            percent of the sponsor&apos;s approved administrative budget. The
            amount of the start-up payment shall be deducted from the first
            advance payment for administrative costs or, if the sponsor does not
            receive advance payments, from the first administrative
            reimbursement.

             Sponsors eligible to receive commodities under the Program include:
            Self-preparation sponsors; sponsors which have entered into an
            agreement with a school or school food authority for the preparation
            of meals; and sponsors which are school food authorities and have

            management company from which they competitively procured meals for
            the National School Lunch Program during the last period in which
            school was in session. The State agency shall make available to
            these sponsors information on available commodities. Sponsors shall
            use in the Program food donated by the Department and accepted by
            sponsors.

             Not later than June 1 of each year, State agencies shall prepare a

            these sponsors. If the State agency does not handle the distribution

            for all other sponsors whose requests are received at least 30 days

            those dates shall be acted upon within 30 days of receipt. When

            projected administrative costs do not differ significantly from the

            less than 10 days in June but for at least 10 days in August, the
            second advance administrative costs payment shall be made by August

             In conducting management evaluations or audits for any fiscal year,
            the State agency, FNS or OIG may disregard overpayment which does
            not exceed $100 or, in the case of State agency administered
            programs, does not exceed the amount established by State law,
            regulations or procedures as a minimum for which claims will be made
            for State losses generally. No overpayment shall be disregarded,
            however, when there are unpaid claims for the same fiscal year from
            which the overpayment can be deducted or when there is substantial
            evidence of violation of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.

             Each State agency shall promptly investigate complaints received or
            irregularities noted in connection with the operation of the
            Program, and shall take appropriate action to correct any
            irregularities. The State agency shall maintain on file all evidence
            relating to such investigations and actions. The State agency shall
            inform the appropriate FNSRO of any suspected fraud or criminal
            abuse in the Program which would result in a loss or misuse of
            Federal funds. The Department may make investigations at the request
            of the State agency, or where the Department determines
            investigations are appropriate.

             Except as specified below, the State agency shall not enter into an
            agreement with any applicant sponsor identifiable through its
            corporate organization, officers, employees, or otherwise, as an
            institution which participated in any Federal child nutrition
            program and was seriously deficient in its operation of any such
            program. The State agency shall terminate the Program agreement with
            any sponsor which it determines to be seriously deficient. However,
            the State agency shall afford a sponsor reasonable opportunity to
            correct problems before terminating the sponsor for being seriously
            deficient. The State agency may approve the application of a sponsor
            which has been disapproved or terminated in prior years in
            accordance with this paragraph if the sponsor demonstrates to the
            satisfaction of the State agency that the sponsor has taken
            appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the
            deficiencies. Serious deficiencies which are grounds for disapproval
            of applications and for termination include, but are not limited to,
            any of the following:

            (i.e., breakfasts, lunches, supplements, or suppers) during the

            nutritious and well-balanced meals to each child. Sponsors shall
            ensure that meals served meet all of the requirements. Except as
            otherwise provided in this section, the following tables present the
            minimum requirements for meals served to children in the Program.
            Children age 12 and up may be served larger portions based on the
            greater food needs of older boys and girls.

            and seed meals or flours shall not be used as a meat alternate

            part under Appendix A: Alternate Foods for Meals. As noted in

            no more than one-half of the meat/meat alternate requirement for
            lunch or supper. Therefore, nuts or seeds must be combined with
            another meat/meat alternate to fulfill the requirement. For the

            of the meat/meat alternate requirement.

            shucking, and grinding; forming ground products into patties without
            any additives or fillers; drying/dehydration; washing; packaging
