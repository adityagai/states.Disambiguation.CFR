          The Secretary shall, after consultation with the official empowered to
          exercise the authority provided for by 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            section 302(a) of
          </aref>
           the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, establish temporary emergency
          standards of eligibility for the duration of the emergency for
          households who are victims of a disaster which disrupts commercial
          channels of food distribution, if such households are in need of
          temporary food assistance and if commercial channels of food
          distribution have again become available to meet the temporary food
          needs of such households. Such standards as are prescribed for
          individual emergencies may be promulgated without regard to 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            section 4(c) of
          </aref>
           this Act or the procedures set forth in 
          <aref type='UNKNOWN'>
            section 553 of
          </aref>
           Title 5 of the United States Code. In addition to establishing
          temporary emergency standards of eligibility, the Secretary shall
          provide for emergency allotments to eligible households to replace
          food destroyed in a disaster. Such emergency allotments would be equal
          to the value of the food actually lost in such disaster but not
          greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the
          household size. The Secretary may also approve alternate methods for
          issuing food stamp benefits during a disaster when reliance on
          Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) systems is impracticable.
