             In addition to the exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this
            section, the Administrator may grant a specific exemption upon a
            showing of good cause and upon his or her determination that such
            exemption is consistent with protecting plant health or plant
            products. An individual or entity may request in writing an
            exemption from the requirements of this part. If granted, such
            exemptions are valid for a maximum of 3 years; thereafter, an
            individual or entity must request a new exemption. If a request for
            exemption is denied, an individual or entity may request
            reconsideration in writing to the Administrator. The request for
            reconsideration must state all of the facts and reasons upon which
            the individual or entity relies to show that the exemption was
            wrongfully denied. The Administrator will grant or deny the request
            for reconsideration as promptly as circumstances allow and will
            state, in writing, the reasons for the decision.
