          The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (

          ) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of the
          environment. 
          <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>
            Section 102(2
          </aref>
          ) of NEPA contains certain procedural requirements directed toward the
          attainment of such goals. Section (102)(2) also requires all Federal
          agencies to give appropriate consideration to the environmental
          effects of their proposed actions in their decisionmaking and to
          prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or
          reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions
          significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
          Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977 (
          <aref type='FREGIST'>
            42 FR 26967
          </aref>
          ), directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue
          regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA.
          Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA regulations (
          <aref type='CFR'>

           through 1508) on November 29, 1978, which are binding on all Federal
          agencies as of July 30, 1979. These regulations provide that each
          Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing procedures to
          supplement the regulations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted
          such procedures in a final rule (

             Initial NEPA involvement in program categories in paragraph (b) of
            this section shall begin at the time FSA begins developing proposed
            legislation, begins the planning stage for implementing a new or
            changed program or receives notice that an ongoing program may have
            a significant adverse impact on the quality of the human
            environment. Where a legislative EIS or environmental assessment is
            part of the formal transmittal of a legislative program proposal to
            Congress, such legislative EIS or assessment may negate the need for
            the subsequent preparation of a program impact statement when FSA
            implements the resulting program. The decision whether such
            additional statement is needed will be made by an interdisciplinary
            team. The NEPA process on legislative proposals and FSA programs is
            carried out at the national level.

             Individual farm participation in FSA programs will normally not
            require any major involvement with the NEPA process. The practices
            carried out under FSA programs that might have impacts on the
            quality of the human environment will normally have been discussed
            in environmental assessments or impact statements on the applicable
            programs. However, for those practices that might significantly
            affect the quality of the human environment, the county committee 
            <PRTPAGE P='404' />
            shall make an environmental evaluation before approval. If the
            environmental evaluation shows that the implementation of a proposed
            FSA practice on an individual farm will have significant adverse
            affects on the quality of the human environment, the county
            committee will not approve the practice implementation until after
            the completion of the NEPA-EIS process in accordance with this part.
            For those actions for which technical assistance is provided by an
            agency other than FSA, and such technical agency is required by its
            regulations to implement NEPA requirements when providing such
            assistance, the county committee shall use the environmental
            determination and considerations of such agency instead of
            duplicating the NEPA-EIS process. Individual farm participation in
            acreage set-aside, acreage allotments, price support and loans and
            other similar or related programs will not significantly affect the
            quality of the human environment.

             Pooling agreements and special projects carried out under several
            FSA programs involving two or more farmers in a local geographic
            area will not normally require any major involvement with the NEPA
            process. However, the county committee shall, with the assistance of
            a local interdisciplinary team, as necessary, make an environmental
            evaluation of proposed pooling agreements or special projects that
            have a potential for significantly affecting the quality of the
            human environment. The NEPA process shall begin with the initial
            involvement of FSA personnel in the planning or development of
            pooling agreements or special projects. If it is determined from an
            environmental evaluation that the implementation of a proposed
            pooling agreement or a proposed special project will have a
            significant adverse impact on the quality of the human environment,
            the completion of the NEPA-EIS process in accordance with these
            regulations will be necessary before approval. For those actions for
            which technical assistance is provided by an agency other than FSA
            and such technical agency is required by its regulations to
            implement NEPA when providing such assistance the county committee
            shall use the environmental determinations and considerations of
            such agency instead of duplicating the NEPA-EIS process.
