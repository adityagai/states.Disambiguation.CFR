             to renew, postpone, or modify annual installments due under a
            promissory note because of the borrower&apos;s entry into the armed
            services. However, under the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Civil
            Relief Act of 1940, the property of a borrower in the armed forces
            cannot validly be seized or sold by foreclosure or otherwise during
            the borrower&apos;s tenure of service, or for three months
            thereafter, except (1) pursuant to an agreement entered into by the
            borrower after having been accepted for service, or (2) by order of
            the Court. Any person causing an invalid sale to be made is guilty
            of a misdemeanor. Regardless of the foregoing, the long-time
            interest of the borrower can best be served by prompt and
            satisfactory arrangements for the use and protection, or
            disposition, of the security property in accordance with the
            policies expressed herein. Upon request, OGC will inform the State
            Director with respect to relief which may be secured by a borrower
            under the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Civil Relief Act of 1940.

            When information is received that a borrower is entering the armed

            be encouraged to sell the property and apply the proceeds to the

            Director will consult with OGC concerning any limitations upon the
            use of a power of attorney under local law and the circumstances
            under which the power of attorney should be exercised. In general,
            either spouse may act as attorney-in-fact for the other spouse, but,
            in a few States, a spouse cannot exercise the power of attorney in
            connection with a sale or encumbrance of the homestead. In a
            majority of States, a power of attorney is revoked by the death of a
            person granting the power, but, in some States, the power of
            attorney executed by a person in the armed services remains valid
            until actual notice is received of the death of the person granting
            the power. A power of attorney should not be used in conveying title
            to the farm except in those States where the power is good until
            actual notice of death. The State Director will request OGC to
            prepare a satisfactory form of power of attorney which may be
            duplicated in the State Office and furnished to County Supervisors
            with a State supplement concerning its use.

            any evidence to indicate that abandonment has, in fact, taken place.
            In these instances, it must be recognized that the borrower may have
            entered into verbal arrangements for the care of the security
            without properly advising the County Supervisor. Whether such cases

            sell the property, while evidencing no interest in it or desire to
            retain it, will be processed in accordance with applicable

             The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act requires that the effective
            interest rate charged a borrower who enters active military duty
            after a loan is closed will not exceed 6 percent. This applies only
            to full-time active military duty and does not include military
            reserve status or National Guard participation.

             As soon as the County Supervisor verifies that a borrower is on
            active duty, the County Supervisor will send the borrower a letter
            which states that the interest rate on the borrower&apos;s FmHA or
            its successor agency under 
            <aref target='_blank' title='Public Law 103-354' alt='Public Law 103-354' href='http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d103:./list/bd/d103pl.lst:354%28Public_Laws%29'>

             loans will not exceed 6 percent. At the same time, the County
            Supervisor will send the Finance Office a memorandum which states
            that the borrower is on active duty and that interest of not more
            than 6 percent should accrue on the borrower&apos;s loans, effective
            as of the date of the memorandum or as of the date of the last
            payment, whichever is later, until further notice. If a
            borrower&apos;s interest rate on any loan is less than 6 percent,
            the loan will continue to accrue interest at the lower rate. The
            assistance under this section may not be retroactively applied.

             As soon as the County Supervisor verifies that a borrower is no
            longer on active duty, the County Supervisor will send the Finance
            Office a memorandum advising them to terminate the 6 percent
            interest rate. The rate will revert to the note rate (or the payment
            assistance rate), effective with the next scheduled payment. The 6
            percent interest rate will not be cancelled retroactively.
