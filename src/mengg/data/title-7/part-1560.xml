        <P>
          The specific group of articles that will be monitored as a particular
          fresh fruit or vegetable will be determined based on the
          practicability of monitoring at the eight digit subheading level of
          the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The determination
          of practicability will be made by the Administrator taking into
          account: (a) The availability of reliable volume and price data on
          imports from Canada and data on U.S. planted acreage, (b) market
          differentiation for the group of articles, and (c) such other factors
          as the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

             If for each of five consecutive working days the import price of

             The planted acreage in the United States for such fresh fruit or

            October 4, 1987 shall be excluded.
