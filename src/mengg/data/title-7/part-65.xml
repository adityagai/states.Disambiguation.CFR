           means a retail item derived from a covered commodity that has
          undergone specific processing resulting in a change in the character
          of the covered commodity, or that has been combined with at least one
          other covered commodity or other substantive food component (e.g.,
          chocolate, breading, tomato sauce), except that the addition of a
          component (such as water, salt, or sugar) that enhances or represents
          a further step in the preparation of the product for consumption,
          would not in itself result in a processed food item. Specific
          processing that results in a change in the character of the covered
          commodity includes cooking (e.g., frying, broiling, grilling, boiling,
          steaming, baking, roasting), curing (e.g., salt curing, sugar curing,
          drying), smoking (hot or cold), and restructuring (e.g., emulsifying
          and extruding). Examples of items excluded include teriyaki flavored
          pork loin, roasted peanuts, breaded chicken tenders, and fruit medley.

             Any person engaged in the business of supplying a covered commodity
            to a retailer, whether directly or indirectly, must make available
            information to the buyer about the country(ies) of origin of the
            covered commodity. This information may be provided either on the
            product itself, on the master shipping container, or in a document
            that accompanies the product through retail sale. In addition, the
            supplier of a covered commodity that is responsible for initiating a
            country(ies) of origin claim, which in the case of beef, lamb,
            chicken, goat, and pork is the slaughter facility, must possess
            records that are necessary to substantiate that claim for a period
            of 1 year from the date of the transaction. For that purpose,
            packers that slaughter animals that are tagged with an 840 Animal
            Identification Number device without the presence of any additional
            accompanying marking (i.e., “CAN” or “M”) may use that information
            as a basis for a U.S. origin claim. Packers that slaughter animals
            that are part of another country&apos;s recognized official system
            (e.g., Canadian official system, Mexico official system) may also
            rely on the presence of an official ear tag or other approved device
            on which to base their origin claims. Producer affidavits shall also
            be considered acceptable records that suppliers may utilize to
            initiate origin claims, provided it is made by someone having
            first-hand knowledge of the origin of the covered commodity and
            identifies the covered commodity unique to the transaction. In the
            case of cattle, producer affidavits may be based on a visual
            inspection of the animal to verify its origin. If no markings are
            found that would indicate that the animal is of foreign origin
            (i.e., “CAN” or “M”), the animal may be considered to be of U.S.
            origin.

             In providing the country of origin notification for a covered
            commodity, in general, retailers are to convey the origin
            information provided by their suppliers. Only if the retailer
            physically commingles a covered commodity of different origins in
            preparation for retail sale, whether in a consumer-ready package or
            in a bulk display (and not discretely packaged) (i.e., full service
            meat case), can the retailer initiate a multiple country of origin
            designation that reflects the actual countries of origin for the
            resulting covered commodity.
