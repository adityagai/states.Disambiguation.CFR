             During the effective period of this subpart, assessments shall be

            States and all watermelons imported into the United States for

            producer, handler, or importer shall be made on any lot of
            watermelons. The handler shall be assessed an equal amount on a per
            unit basis as the producer. If a person performs both producing and
            handling functions on any same lot of watermelons, both assessments
            shall be paid by such person. In the case of an importer, the
            assessment shall be equal to the combined rate for domestic
            producers and handlers and shall be paid by the importer at the time
            of entry of the watermelons into the United States.

             The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time and shall hold a
            referendum on request of the Board or at least 10 percent of the
            combined total of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers
            to determine if watermelon producers, handlers, and importers favor
            termination or suspension of this Plan. The Secretary shall suspend
            or terminate this Plan at the end of the marketing year whenever the
            Secretary determines that the suspension or termination is favored
            by a majority of the watermelon producers, handlers, and importers

            determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production,
            handling, or importing of watermelons and who produced, handled, or
            imported more than 50 percent of the combined total of the volume of
            watermelons produced, handled, or imported by those producers,
            handlers, and importers voting in the referendum. For purposes of
            this section, the vote of a person who both produces and handles
            watermelons will be counted as a handler vote if the producer
            purchased watermelons from other producers, in a combined total
            volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer&apos;s
            own production; or the combined total volume of watermelon handled
            by the producer from the producer&apos;s own production and
            purchases from other producer&apos;s production is more than 50
            percent of the producer&apos;s own production.

          All proxy documentation must be received by the Board at its
          headquarters address at least two weeks before the district convention
          is scheduled to convene. For the purpose of the initial district
          convention, all proxy documentation must be forwarded to the
          Department representative identified in the call for the district
          convention in a manner that will ensure receipt, at the address
          specified in the call, at least 72 hours before the district
          convention is scheduled to convene. The Board, or in the case of the
          initial conventions the Department representative identified in the
          call or other representative of the Department, may challenge any
          proxy vote and disqualify any challenged vote for cause. In the case
          of duplicate proxy authorizations by any person, only the first
          authorization, determined by date will be allowed. In the case of
          duplicate dates, the proxy which is received first will be allowed.

             The Board may enter into agreements, subject to approval of the
            Secretary, authorizing other organizations, such as a regional
            watermelon association or State watermelon board, to collect
            assessments in its behalf. In any State or area in which the Board
            has entered into such an agreement, the designated handler shall pay
            the assessment to such agency in the time and manner, and with such
            identifying information as specified in such agreement. Such an
            agreement shall not provide any cooperating agency with authority to
            collect confidential information from handlers or producers. To
            qualify, the cooperating agency must 
            <PRTPAGE P='152' />
            on its own accord have access to all information required by the
            Board for collection purposes. If the Board requires further
            evidence of payment than provided by the cooperating agency, it may
            acquire such evidence from individual handlers. All such agreements
            are subject to the requirements of the Act, Plan, and all applicable
            rules and regulations under the Act and the Plan.
