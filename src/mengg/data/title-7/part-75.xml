        <P>
          After an appeal inspection has been completed, an appeal inspection
          certificate shall be issued showing the results of such appeal
          inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection
          certificate previously issued for the seed involved. Each appeal
          inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and date of
          the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded
          certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal
          inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality or
          condition of the seed described therein. The inspector issuing an
          appeal inspection certificate shall forward notice of such issuance to
          such persons as considered necessary to prevent misuse of the
          superseded certificate if the original and all copies of such
          superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the
          inspector issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The appeal
          inspection certificate shall be marked as to the existence of the
          outstanding certificate. The provisions in the regulations concerning
          forms of certificates and disposition of certificates shall apply to
          appeal inspection certificates, except that copies of such appeal
          inspection certificates shall be furnished to all interested parties
          who received copies of the superseded certificate.

          Pending final action by the Administrator, the Director may suspend,
          whenever it is deemed that such action is necessary to assure that any
          service provided is performed properly, the license of any inspector,
          issued pursuant to the regulations by giving notice of such suspension
          to the respective licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons
          therefore. Within 7 days after receipt of notice and statement of
          reasons by a licensee, an appeal may be filed in writing with the
          Administrator supported by any argument or evidence as to why the
          license should not be suspended. After expiration of the 7-day period
          and consideration of such argument and evidence, the Administrator
          shall take such action as deemed appropriate with respect to a
          suspension or revocation.
