            on the Board shall be announced by the Secretary and shall not

            potato, potato products and/or seed potato importers to assist in
            nominating importers for membership on the Board. If such
            organizations fail to submit nominees or are determined by the Board
            to not adequately represent importers, then the Board may conduct
            meetings of importers to nominate eligible importers for Board
            member positions. In determining if importer organizations
            adequately represent importers, the Board shall consider:

            more than five of its members to the Secretary to serve as trustees
            for the purpose of liquidating the affairs of the Board. Such
            persons, upon designation by the Secretary, shall become trustees of
            all funds and property then in the possession or under control of
            the Board including claims for any funds unpaid or property not
            delivered or any other claim existing at the time of such

            Board under any contracts or agreements entered into by it pursuant
            to this plan; (3) account for all receipts and disbursements and
            deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of
            the Board and of the trustees, to such person or persons as the
            Secretary may direct; and (4) upon the request of the Secretary

            impractical to return such remaining funds to producers and
            importers, such funds shall be disposed of in such manner as the
            Secretary may determine to be appropriate.

             Producer utilizes potatoes of his own production for seed in
            planting his subsequent crop. Such seed potatoes do not enter the
            current of commerce; there is no designated handler in this instance
            since the potatoes have not been handled as heretofore defined and
            no assessment is due. However, seed potatoes sold or shipped to
            other producers for planting or to other persons for subsequent
            disposition enter the current of commerce and are subject to
            assessment. The producer of seed potatoes shall be the designated
            handler of such potatoes shipped to other producers for planting and
            the assessment is due when he first sells or otherwise handles such
            potatoes. The first person who acquires seed potatoes from the
            producer thereof for subsequent disposition other than planting by
            said person shall be the designated handler of such potatoes.
            However, the seed producer will be the designated handler
            responsible for filing reports and making payments, unless he can
            show that the first person who obtained the potatoes from him
            disposed of them other than by planting. To show this the seed
            producer must submit to the Potato Board the name and address of the
            first person who obtained the potatoes from him and an invoice of
            sale or settlement sheet on which it is indicated that such person
            will be the designated 
            <PRTPAGE P='89' />
            handler and therefore will be responsible for the payment of the
            assessments. Only by showing this is the seed producer no longer
            considered the designated handler and therefore not liable for the
            assessments.

             The designated handler is responsible for payment of the assessment
            on domestically produced potatoes. He may pay with no reimbursement
            from the producer. In the alternative, he may collect the assessment
            from the producer, or deduct such assessment from the proceeds paid
            to the producer on whose potatoes the assessment is made, provided
            he furnishes the producer with evidence of such payment. Any such
            collection or deduction of assessment shall be made not later than
            the time when the assessment becomes payable by the handler to the
            Board. Failure of the handler to collect or deduct such assessment
            does not relieve the handler of his obligation to remit the
            assessment to the Board.

            potatoes, potato products, and seed potatoes—on a form provided by
            the Board—at any time initially and annually thereafter on or before

            will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the
            importer. The Board will also issue the importer a 9-digit

            for 1 year from the date of issue. This HTS classification should be
            entered by the importer on the Customs entry documentation. Any line

            seed potatoes bearing this HTS classification assigned by the Board
            will not be subject to assessments.
