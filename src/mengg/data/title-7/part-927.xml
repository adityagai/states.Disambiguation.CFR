            the Processed Pear Committee, with the approval of the Secretary,
            shall prescribe the amount of such late payment charge and rate of
            interest.

            make advance payments of assessments, which advance payments shall

            advance assessment payments.

             If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in
            excess of expenses incurred, the Fresh Pear Committee or the
            Processed Pear Committee may carryover such excess into subsequent

            expense authorized under this part and to cover necessary expenses
            of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Any such
            excess not retained in a reserve or applied to any outstanding
            obligation of the person from whom it was collected shall be
            refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected.
            Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the
