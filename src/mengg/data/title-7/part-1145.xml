          A handler may not require participation in a forward pricing contract
          as a condition of the handler receiving milk from a producer or
          cooperative association of producers. USDA will investigate all
          complaints made by producers or cooperative associations alleging
          coercion by handlers to enter into forward contracts and based on the
          results of the investigation will take appropriate action.
