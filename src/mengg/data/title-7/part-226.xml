           the National School Lunch Act, as amended, authorizes assistance to
          States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain,
          and expand nonprofit food service programs for children or adult
          participants in nonresidential institutions which provide care. The
          Program is intended to enable such institutions to integrate a
          nutritious food service with organized care services for enrolled
          participants. Payments will be made to State agencies or FNS Regional
          Offices to enable them to reimburse institutions for food service to
          enrolled participants.

            served. Such current-year adjustments will not be routine and will

             Each State agency must establish application procedures to
            determine the eligibility of renewing institutions under this part.
            Renewing institutions must not be required to submit a free and
            reduced-price policy statement or a nondiscrimination statement
            unless they make substantive changes to either statement. The State
            agency must require each renewing institution participating in the
            Program to reapply for participation at a time determined by the
            State agency, except that no institution may be allowed to
            participate for less than 12 or more than 36 calendar months under
            an existing application, except when the State agency determines
            that unusual circumstances warrant reapplication in less than 12
            months. The State agency must establish factors, consistent with 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            organization has sufficient staff to perform required monitoring
            responsibilities at all of its sponsored facilities. As part of the
            review of the renewing sponsoring organization&apos;s management
            plan, the State agency must determine the appropriate level of
            staffing for the sponsoring organization, consistent with the

            requirement no later than July 29, 2003. At a minimum, the
            application review procedures established by the State agency must
            require that renewing institutions submit information to the State
            agency in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. In
            addition, the State agency&apos;s application review procedures must
            ensure that the following information is included in a renewing

            principals and responsible individuals notice of the serious

            threat to the health or safety of participants, or the institution
            has engaged in activities that threaten the public health or safety,
            the State agency must follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(5)(i)

            serious deficiency is the submission of a false or fraudulent claim,
            in addition to the procedures below, the State agency may suspend
            the institution&apos;s participation in accordance with paragraph

             If State or local health or licensing officials have cited an
            institution for serious health or safety violations, the State
            agency must immediately suspend the institution&apos;s Program

            that the institution has engaged in activities that threaten the
            public health or safety, the State agency must immediately notify

            (including all Program payments), effective on the date of the

             A State agency is prohibited from paying any claims for
            reimbursement submitted by a suspended institution. However, if the
            institution suspended for the submission of false or fraudulent
            claims is a sponsoring organization, the State agency must ensure
            that sponsored facilities continue to receive reimbursement for

            reimbursement for eligible meals served and allowable administrative

            submitted by institutions for centers or homes for which licensing
            or approval is not available in order to establish eligibility for
            the Program. Licensing or approval is not available when (i) no
            Federal, State, or local licensing/approval standards have been
            established for child care centers, or day care homes; or (ii) no
            mechanism exists to determine compliance with licensing/approval
            standards. In these situations, independent centers, and sponsoring
            organizations on behalf of their facilities, may choose to
            demonstrate compliance with either CACFP child care standards,
            applicable State child care standards, or applicable local child
            care standards. State agencies shall provide information about
            applicable State child care standards and CACFP child care standards
            to institutions, but may require institutions electing to
            demonstrate compliance with applicable local child care standards to
            identify and submit these standards. The State agency may permit
            independent centers, and sponsoring organizations on behalf of their
            facilities, to submit self-certification forms, and may grant
            approval without first conducting a compliance review at the center
            or facility. But the State agency shall require submission of
            health/sanitation and fire/safety permits or certificates for all
            independent centers and facilities seeking alternate child care
            standards approval. Compliance with applicable child care standards

            the tiering status of tier I day care homes based on updated
            elementary school data. However, a sponsoring organization, the

            becomes available indicating that a day care home is no longer in a
            qualified area.

            cash-in-lieu of commodities shall receive such payments. Each

            commodities to the State commodity distribution agency, unless FNS
            has approved a request for cash-in-lieu of commodities for all

             The State agency must review institution budgets and must limit

            Sponsoring organizations must submit an administrative budget to the
            State agency annually, and independent centers must submit budgets
            as frequently as required by the State agency. Budget levels may be
            adjusted to reflect changes in Program activities. If the
            institution does not intend to use non-CACFP funds to support any
            required CACFP functions, the institution&apos;s budget must
            identify a source of non-Program funds that could be used to pay
            overclaims or other unallowable costs. If the institution intends to
            use any non-Program resources to meet CACFP requirements, these
            non-Program funds should be accounted for in the institution&apos;s
            budget, and the institution&apos;s budget must identify a source of
            non-Program funds that could be used to pay overclaims or other
            unallowable costs. For sponsoring organizations of centers, the
            State agency is prohibited from approving the sponsoring
            organization&apos;s administrative budget, or any amendments to the
            budget, if the administrative budget shows the Program will be
            charged for administrative costs in excess of 15 percent of the meal
            reimbursements estimated to be earned during the budget year.
            However, the State agency may waive this limit if the sponsoring
            organization provides justification that it requires Program funds
            in excess of 15 percent to pay its administrative costs and if the
            State agency is convinced that the institution will have adequate
            funding to provide meals meeting the requirements of 
            <aref type='CFR-TIC-SECT'>

            fiscal year, the State agency, FNS, or OIG may disregard an
            overpayment if the overpayment does not exceed $600. A State agency
            may establish, through State law, regulation or procedure, an
            alternate disregard threshold that does not exceed $600. This
            disregard may be made once per each management evaluation, review,
            or audit per Program within a fiscal year. However, no overpayment
            is to be disregarded where there is substantial evidence of
            violations of criminal law or civil fraud statutes.

             The State agency shall assign rates of reimbursement, not less
            frequently than annually, on the basis of family-size and income
            information reported by each institution. However, no rates should
            be assigned for emergency shelters and at-risk afterschool care
            centers. Assigned rates of reimbursement may be changed more

            income information. Assigned rates of reimbursement shall be
            adjusted annually to reflect changes in the national average payment
            rates.

            eligibility. Sponsoring organizations of for-profit child care

            capacity, whichever is less) that documents that at least 25 percent
            are eligible for free or reduced-price meals or are title XX

            submit a claim for any for-profit center in which less than 25
            percent of the children in care (enrolled or licensed capacity,
            whichever is less) during the claim month were eligible for free or
            reduced-price meals or were title XX beneficiaries. Independent
            for-profit adult day care centers shall submit the percentages of
            enrolled adult participants receiving title XIX or title XX benefits
            for the month claimed for months in which not less than 25 percent
            of enrolled adult participants were title XIX or title XX
            beneficiaries. Sponsoring organizations of such adult day care
            centers shall submit the percentage of enrolled adult participants
            receiving title XIX or title XX benefits for each center for the
            claim. Sponsoring organizations of such centers shall not submit
            claims for adult day care centers in which less than 25 percent of

            following the last day of the full month covered by the claim. State

            corrective action with respect to any Claim for Reimbursement as
            determined necessary through its claim review process or otherwise.
            In taking such corrective action, State agencies may make upward
            adjustments in Program funds claimed on claims filed within the 60
            day deadline if such adjustments are completed within 90 days of the
            last day of the claim month and are reflected in the final Report of
            the Child and Adult Care Food Programs (FNS-44) for the claim month
            which is required under 226.7(d). Upward adjustments in Program
            funds claimed which are not reflected in the final FNS-44 for the
            claim month shall not be made unless authorized by FNS. Downward
            adjustments in Program funds claimed shall always be made without
            FNS authorization regardless of when it is determined that such
            adjustments are necessary.

             Payments must be made only to institutions operating under an
            agreement with the State agency for the meal types specified in the
            agreement served at approved child care centers, at-risk afterschool
            care centers, adult day care centers, emergency shelters, and
            outside-school-hours care centers. A State agency may develop a
            policy under which centers are reimbursed for meals served in
            accordance with provisions of the Program in the calendar month
            preceding the calendar month in which the agreement is executed, or
            the State agency may develop a policy under which centers receive
            reimbursement only for meals served in approved centers on and after
            the effective date of the Program agreement. If the State
            agency&apos;s policy permits centers to earn reimbursement for meals

            participating sponsoring organizations of less than 50 homes which
            meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be
            entitled to receive start-up payments to develop or expand
            successful Program operations in day care homes. Participating
            sponsoring organizations of day care homes which meet the criteria
            in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be entitled to receive
            expansion payments to initiate or expand Program operations in day
            care homes in low-income or rural areas. The State agency shall
            approve start-up payments only once for any eligible sponsoring
            organization, but may approve expansion payments for any eligible
            sponsoring organization more than once, provided that: the request
            must be for expansion into an area(s) other than that specified in
            their initial or prior request; and 12 months has elapsed since the
            sponsoring organization has satisfied all obligations under its
            initial or prior expansion agreement. Eligible sponsoring
            organizations which have received start-up payments shall be
            eligible to apply for expansion payments at a date no earlier than
            12 months after it has satisfied all its obligations under its
            start-up agreement with the State agency.

            no sponsoring organization may receive start-up or expansion
            payments for more than 50 day care homes. Eligible sponsoring
            organizations with fewer than 50 homes under their jurisdiction at
            the time of application for start-up payments may receive such
            payments for up to 50 homes, less the number of homes under their

            shall consider the anticipated level of start-up or expansion costs
            to be incurred by the sponsoring organization and alternate sources

             State agencies shall disallow any portion of a claim for
            reimbursement and recover any payment to an institution not properly
            payable under this part. State agencies may consider claims for
            reimbursement not properly payable if an institution does not comply
            with the recordkeeping requirements contained in this part. The
            State agency may permit institutions to pay overclaims over a period
            of one or more years. However, the State agency must assess interest
            beginning with the date stipulated in the State agency&apos;s demand
            letter, or 30 days after the date of the demand letter, whichever
            date is later. Further, when 
            <PRTPAGE P='239' />
            an institution requests and is granted an administrative review of
            the State agency&apos;s overpayment demand, the State agency is
            prohibited from taking action to collect or offset the overpayment
            until the administrative review is concluded. The State agency must
            maintain searchable records of funds recovery activities. If the
            State agency determines that a sponsoring organization of centers
            has spent more than 15 percent of its meal reimbursements for a
            budget year for administrative costs (or more than any higher limit
            established pursuant to a waiver granted under

            ), the State agency must take appropriate fiscal action. In
            addition, except with approval from the appropriate FNSRO, State
            agencies shall consider claims for reimbursement not payable when an
            institution fails to comply with the recordkeeping requirements that
            pertain to records directly supporting claims for reimbursement.
            Records that directly support claims for reimbursement include, but
            are not limited to, daily meal counts, menu records, and enrollment
            and attendance records, as required by

            organization of day care homes which misclassifies a day care home
            as a tier I day care home unless the misclassification is determined
            to be inadvertent under guidance issued by FNS. However, the State
            agency shall notify the institution of the reasons for any
            disallowance or demand for repayment, and allow the institution full
            opportunity to submit evidence on appeal as provided for in

            a corrective effect. However, the State agency shall not disregard

             Each sponsoring organization of day care homes shall determine
            which of the day care homes under its sponsorship are eligible as
            tier I day care homes. A sponsoring organization may use current
            school or census data provided by the State agency or free and
            reduced price applications collected from day care home providers in
            making a determination for each day care home. When using elementary
            school or census data for making tier I day care home
            determinations, a sponsoring organization shall first consult school
            data, except in cases in which busing or other bases of attendance,
            such as magnet or charter schools, result in school data not being
            representative of an attendance area&apos;s household income levels.
            In these cases, census data should generally be consulted instead of
            school data. A sponsoring organization may also use census data if,
            after reasonable efforts are made, as defined by the State agency,
            the sponsoring organization is unable to obtain local elementary
            school attendance area information. A sponsoring organization may
            also consult census data after having consulted school data which
            fails to support a tier I day care home determination for rural
            areas with geographically large elementary school attendance areas,
            for other areas in which an elementary school&apos;s free and
            reduced price enrollment is above 40 percent, or in other cases with
            State agency approval. However, if a sponsoring organization
            believes that a segment of an otherwise eligible elementary school
            attendance area is above the criteria for free or reduced price
            meals, then the sponsoring organization shall consult census data to
            determine whether the homes in that area qualify as tier I day care
            homes based on census data. If census data does not support a tier I
            classification, then the sponsoring organization shall reclassify
            homes in segments of such areas as tier II day care homes unless the
            individual providers can document tier I eligibility on the basis of
            their household income. When making tier I day care home
            determinations based on school data, a sponsoring organization shall
            use attendance area information that it has obtained, or verified
            with appropriate school officials to be current, within the last
            school year. Determinations of a day care home&apos;s eligibility as
            a tier I day care home shall be valid for one year if based on a
            provider&apos;s household income, five years if based on school
            data, or until more current data are available if based on census
            data. However, a sponsoring organization, State agency, or FNS may
            change the determination if information becomes available indicating
            that a home is no longer in a qualified area. The State agency shall
            not routinely require annual redeterminations of the tiering status
            of tier I day care homes based on updated elementary school data.

            care homes must document that, to perform monitoring, it will employ
            the equivalent of one full-time staff person for each 50 to 150 day
            care homes it sponsors. As part of its management plan, a sponsoring
            organization of centers must document that, to perform monitoring,
            it will employ the equivalent of one full-time staff person for each
            25 to 150 centers it sponsors. It is the State agency&apos;s
            responsibility to determine the appropriate level of staffing for
            monitoring for each sponsoring organization, consistent with these
            specified ranges and factors that the State agency will use to
            determine the appropriate level of monitoring staff for each
            sponsor. The monitoring staff equivalent may include the
            employee&apos;s time spent on scheduling, travel time, review time,
            follow-up activity, report writing, and 
            <PRTPAGE P='243' />

            than July 29, 2003, a management plan or plan amendment that meets
            the monitoring staffing requirement. For sponsoring organizations of
            centers, the portion of the administrative costs to be charged to
            the Program may not exceed 15 percent of the meal reimbursements
            estimated or actually earned during the budget year, unless the

            reimbursements estimated to be earned during the budget year will be
            lower than that estimated in its administrative budget, the

            attendance records (except in those outside-school-hours care
            centers, at-risk afterschool care centers, and emergency shelters
            where enrollment records are not required) to determine the number
            of participants in care during each meal service and attempt to
            reconcile those numbers to the numbers of breakfasts, lunches,
            suppers, and/or snacks recorded in the facility&apos;s meal count
            for that day. Based on that comparison, reviewers must determine
            whether the meal counts were accurate. If there is a discrepancy
            between the number of participants enrolled or in attendance on the
            day of review and prior meal counting patterns, the reviewer must
            attempt to reconcile the difference and determine whether the
            establishment of an overclaim is necessary.

            in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, regardless of the type of
            facility), the sponsoring organization may choose not to conduct a
            third review of the facility that year, and may make its second
            review announced, provided that the sponsoring organization conducts
            an average of three reviews of all of its facilities that year, and
            that it conducts an average of two unannounced reviews of all of its
            facilities that year. When the sponsoring organization uses this
            averaging provision, and a specific facility receives two reviews in
            one review year, its first review in the next review year must occur
            no more than nine months after the previous review.

             Child care centers must have Federal, State, or local licensing or
            approval to provide day care services to children. Child care
            centers, which are complying with applicable procedures to renew
            licensing or approval, may participate in the Program during the
            renewal process, unless the State agency has information that
            indicates that renewal will be denied. If licensing or approval is
            not available, a child care center may participate if it
            demonstrates compliance with the CACFP child care standards or any
            applicable State or local child care standards to the State agency.

             Meals served to infants ages birth through 11 months must meet the
            requirements described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Foods
            included in the infant meal must be of a texture and a consistency
            that are appropriate for the age of the infant being served. The
            foods must be served during a span of time consistent with the
            infant&apos;s eating habits. For those infants whose dietary needs
            are more individualized, exceptions to the meal pattern must be made
            in accordance with the requirements found in paragraph (h) of this
            section.

             Either breastmilk or iron-fortified infant formula, or portions of

            breastmilk and meals containing iron-fortified infant formula
            supplied by the facility are eligible for reimbursement. However,
            infant formula provided by a parent (or guardian) and breastmilk fed
            directly by the infant&apos;s mother, during a visit to the
            facility, contribute to a reimbursable meal only when the facility
            supplies at least one component of the infant&apos;s meal.

             Solid foods of an appropriate texture and consistency are required

             Infant meals must have, at a minimum, each of the food components
            indicated, in the amount that is appropriate for the infant&apos;s
            age. For some breastfed infants who regularly consume less than the
            minimum amount of breastmilk per feeding, a serving of less than the
            minimum amount of breastmilk may be offered. In these situations,
            additional breastmilk must be offered if the infant is still hungry.
            Meals may include portions of breastmilk and iron-fortified infant
            formula as long as the total number of ounces meets, or exceeds, the
            minimum amount required of this food component. Similarly, to meet

            in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal law and
            Executive orders.

             Each institution shall annually provide the information media

            with a public release, unless the State agency has issued a
            Statewide media release on behalf of all institutions. All media
            releases issued by institutions other than emergency shelters,
            at-risk afterschool care centers, and sponsoring organizations of
            emergency shelters, at-risk afterschool care centers, or day care
            homes must include the Secretary&apos;s Income Eligibility
            Guidelines for Free and Reduced-Price Meals. The release issued by
            all emergency shelters, at-risk afterschool care centers, and
            sponsoring organizations of emergency shelters, at-risk afterschool
            care centers, or day care homes, and by other institutions which
            elect not to charge separately for meals, must announce the
            availability of meals at no separate charge. The release issued by
            child care institutions which charge separately for meals shall
            announce the availability of free and reduced-price meals to
            children meeting the approved eligibility criteria. The release
            issued by child care institutions shall also announce that children
            who are TANF recipients, SNAP or FDPIR households, or are Head Start
            participants are automatically eligible to receive free meal
            benefits. The release issued by adult day care centers which charge
            separately for meals shall announce the availability of free and
            reduced-price meals to participants meeting the approved eligibility
            criteria. The release issued by adult day care centers shall also
            announce that adult participants who are members of SNAP or FDPIR
            households or who are SSI or Medicaid participants are automatically
            eligible to receive free meal benefits. All releases shall state
            that meals are available to all participants without regard to race,
            color, national origin, sex, age or disability.

             For the purpose of determining eligibility for free and reduced
            price meals, institutions (other than emergency shelters and at-risk
            afterschool care centers) shall distribute applications for free and
            reduced price meals to the families of participants enrolled in the
            institution. Sponsoring 
            <PRTPAGE P='272' />
            organizations of day care homes shall distribute applications for
            free and reduced price meals to day care home providers who wish to
            enroll their own eligible children in the Program. At the request of
            a provider in a tier II day care home, sponsoring organizations of
            day care homes shall distribute applications for free and reduced
            price meals to the households of all children enrolled in the home,
            except that applications need not be distributed to the households
            of enrolled children that the sponsoring organization determines
            eligible for free and reduced price meals under the circumstances
            described in paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section. These
            applications, and any other descriptive material distributed to such
            persons, shall contain only the family-size income levels for
            reduced price meal eligibility with an explanation that households
            with incomes less than or equal to these levels are eligible for
            free or reduced price meals. Such forms and descriptive materials
            may not contain the income standards for free meals. However, such
            forms and materials distributed by child care institutions other
            than sponsoring organizations of day care homes shall state that, if
            a child is a member of a SNAP or FDPIR household or is a TANF
            recipient, the child is automatically eligible to receive free
            Program meal benefits, subject to the completion of the application
            as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; such forms and
            materials distributed by sponsoring organizations of day care homes
            shall state that, if a child or a child&apos;s parent is
            participating in or subsidized under a Federally or State supported
            child care or other benefit program with an income eligibility limit
            that does not exceed the eligibility standard for free or reduced
            price meals, meals served to the child are automatically eligible
            for tier I reimbursement, subject to the completion of the
            application as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section,
            and shall list any programs identified by the State agency as
            meeting this standard; such forms and materials distributed by adult
            day care centers shall state that, if an adult participant is a
            member of a SNAP or FDPIR household or is a SSI or Medicaid
            participant, the adult participant is automatically eligible to
            receive free Program meal benefits, subject to the completion of the
            application as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
            Sponsoring organizations of day care homes shall not make free and
            reduced price eligibility information concerning individual
            households available to day care homes and shall otherwise limit the
            use of such information to persons directly connected with the
            administration and enforcement of the Program. However, sponsoring
            organizations may inform tier II day care homes of the number of
            identified income-eligible enrolled children. If a State agency
            distributes, or chooses to permit its sponsoring organizations to
            distribute, applications to the households of children enrolled in
            tier II day care homes which include household confidentiality
            waiver statements, such applications shall include a statement
            informing households that their participation in the program is not
            dependent upon signing the waivers. Furthermore, such forms and
            materials distributed by child care institutions shall state that if
            a child is a Head Start participant, the child is automatically
            eligible to receive free Program meal benefits, subject to
            submission by Head Start officials of a Head Start statement of
            income eligibility or income eligibility documentation.

            tribal organization or welfare office to determine current
            certification for receipt of SNAP or FDPIR benefits, contacting the
            issuing office of SSI or Medicaid benefits to determine current
            certification for receipt of these benefits, contacting the State
            employment security office to determine the amount of benefits
            received, and checking the documentation produced by household
            members to provide the amount of income received. These efforts may
            result in loss or reduction of benefits, administrative claims or
