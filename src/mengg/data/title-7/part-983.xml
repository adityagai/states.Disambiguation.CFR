          policy covering quality regulations for the pending crop. In the event
          it becomes advisable to modify such policy, because of changed crop
          conditions, the committee shall formulate a new policy and shall
          submit a report thereon to the Secretary. In developing the marketing
          policy, the committee shall give consideration to the production,
          harvesting, processing and storage conditions of that crop. The
          committee may also give consideration to current prices being received
          and the probable general level of prices to be received for pistachios
          by producers and handlers. Notice of the committee&apos;s marketing
          policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be given promptly by
          reasonable publicity, to producers and handlers.

             If a lot fails to meet the aflatoxin and/or the quality
            requirements of this part, a failed lot notification report shall be
            completed and sent to the committee within 10 working days of the
            test failure. This form must be completed and submitted to the
            committee each time a lot fails either aflatoxin or quality testing.
            The accredited laboratories shall send the failed lot notification
            reports for aflatoxin tests to the committee, and the handler, under
            the supervision of an inspector, shall send the failed lot
            notification reports for the lots that do not meet the quality
            requirements to the committee.

          Upon the termination of this part, the members of the committee then
          functioning shall continue as joint trustees, for the purpose of
          liquidating the affairs of the committee. Action by such trustees
          shall require the concurrence of a majority of said trustees. Such
          trustees shall continue in such capacity until discharged by the
          Secretary, and shall account for all receipts and disbursements and
          deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of
          the committee and the joint trustees, to such persons as the Secretary
          may direct; and shall upon the request of the Secretary, execute such
          assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in
          such person full title and right to all the funds, properties, and
          claims vested in the committee or the joint trustees, pursuant to this
          part. Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been
          transferred or delivered by the committee or the joint trustees,
          pursuant to this section, shall be subject to the same obligations
          imposed upon the members of said committee and upon said joint
