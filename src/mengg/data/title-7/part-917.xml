            are reasonable and are likely to be incurred by the commodity

            the Secretary relative to such expenses, and such increase shall

             In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the
            commodity committee prior to commencement of shipments in any
            season, shippers may make advance payments of assessments, which
            advance payments shall be credited to such shippers and the
            assessments of such shippers shall be adjusted so that such
            assessments are based upon the quantity of fruit shipped by such
            shippers during such season. Any shipper who ships fruit for the
            account of a grower may deduct, from the account of sale covering
            such shipment or shipments, the amount of assessments levied on said
            fruit shipped for the account of such grower.

            information submitted by the commodity committee or from other
            available information, that a regulation should be modified,
            suspended, or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of
            fruit in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he
            shall modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the
            Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to
            effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or
            terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the
            Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension.
