             The commitment to cultural resource protection is vital. That
            commitment will be balanced with the multiple departmental goals of
            food and fiber production, environmental protection, natural
            resource and energy conservation, and rural development. It is
            essential that all of these be managed to reduce conflicts between
            programs. Positive management of the cultural environment can
            contribute to achieving better land use, protection of rural
            communities and farm lands, conservation of energy, and more
            efficient use of resources.

             In reaching decisions, the long-term needs of society and the
            irreversible nature of an action must be considered. The Department
            must act to preserve future options; loss of important cultural
            resources must be avoided except in the face of overriding national
            interest where there are no reasonable alternatives.
