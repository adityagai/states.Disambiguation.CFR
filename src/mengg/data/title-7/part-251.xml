            documents incorporated into the agreement by reference if permitted

             After a State agency has distributed TEFAP commodities sufficient
            to meet the needs of all emergency feeding organizations, the State
            agency must distribute any remaining program commodities to other
            eligible recipient agencies which serve needy people, but do not
            relieve situations of emergency and distress. A State agency may, at
            its discretion, concentrate commodity resources upon a certain type
            or types of such organizations, to the exclusion of others.

             When a State agency has delegated to an eligible recipient agency
            the authority to select other eligible recipient agencies, the
            eligible recipient agency exercising this authority must ensure that
            any TEFAP commodities are distributed in accordance with the
            priority system set forth in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (h)(1)(ii) of
            this section. State agencies and eligible recipient agencies will be
            deemed to be in compliance with the priority system when eligible

            jurisdiction prior to making commodities available to eligible
            recipient agencies which are not emergency feeding organizations.

            in the State, both public and private, interested in the

            assistance, and other important issues that will help States to use
            their program resources in the most efficient and effective manner
            possible. A State agency may expend TEFAP administrative funds to

            State agencies may establish a higher standard than “predominantly”

            application for recognition of such status and be moving toward
            compliance with the requirements for recognition of tax-exempt
            status. If the IRS denies a participating organization&apos;s
            application for recognition of tax-exempt status, the organization
            must immediately notify the State agency or the eligible recipient
            agency, whichever is appropriate, of such denial, and that agency
            will terminate the organization&apos;s agreement and participation
            immediately upon receipt of such notification. If documentation of
            IRS recognition of tax-exempt status has not been obtained and
            forwarded to the appropriate agency within 180 days of the effective
            date of the organization&apos;s approval for participation in TEFAP,
            the State agency or eligible recipient agency must terminate the
            organization&apos;s participation until such time as recognition of
            tax-exempt status is actually obtained, except that the State agency
            or eligible recipient agency may grant a single extension not to
            exceed 90 days if the organization can demonstrate, to the State
            agency&apos;s or eligible recipient agency&apos;s satisfaction, that
            its inability to obtain tax-exempt status within the 180 day period
            is due to circumstances beyond its control. It is the responsibility
            of the organization to document that it has complied with all IRS
            requirements and has provided all information requested by IRS in a
            timely manner.

             A State agency may delegate to one or more eligible recipient
            agencies with which the State agency enters into an agreement the
            responsibility for the distribution of commodities and
            administrative funds made available under this part. State agencies
            may also delegate the authority for selecting eligible recipient
            agencies and for determining the eligibility of such organizations
            to receive commodities and administrative funds. However,
            responsibility for establishing eligibility criteria for
            organizations in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and
            for establishing recipient eligibility criteria in accordance with
            paragraph (b) of this section, may not be delegated. In instances in
            which State agencies delegate authority to eligible recipient
            agencies to determine the eligibility of organizations to receive
            commodities and administrative funds, eligibility must be determined
            in accordance with the provisions contained in this part and the
            State plan. State agencies will remain responsible for ensuring that
            commodities and administrative funds are distributed in accordance
            with the provisions contained in this part.
