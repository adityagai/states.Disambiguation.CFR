            preceding complete taxable year, as determined by CCC. A new legal
            entity will have its adjusted gross income averaged only for those
            years of the base period for which it was in business; however, a
            new legal entity will not be considered “new” to the extent it takes
            over an existing operation and has any elements of common ownership
            or interests with the preceding legal entity, or with persons or
            legal entities with an interest in the “old” legal entity. When
            there is such commonality, income of the “old” legal entity will be
            averaged with that of the “new” legal entity for the base period.
