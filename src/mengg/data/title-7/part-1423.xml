            operator establishes that the reasons for rejection have been

        <P>
          Before approval, and while a storage agreement is in effect, a
          warehouse must be examined by a person designated by CCC periodically
          to determine compliance with this part. CCC or any other agency of
          USDA shall, at any time, have the right to inspect the warehouse
          storage facilities and any applicable records. Inspection or
          examination by CCC does not absolve the warehouse operator of any
          failure to comply with this part that CCC does not discover. Failure
          to allow access to facilities as required under this paragraph will
          result in rejection or revocation of approval.

             After initial approval, warehouse operators may request that CCC
            reconsider adverse actions when the warehouse operator establishes
            that the reasons for the action have been remedied or requests
            reconsideration of the action and presents to the Director, KCCO, in
            writing, information in support of such request. The warehouse
            operator may, if dissatisfied with the Director&apos;s
            determination, obtain a review of the determination and an informal
            hearing by submitting a request to the Deputy Administrator. Appeals
            shall be as prescribed in
