             Priority will be given to projects: in smaller rural communities,
            in the most needy communities having the highest percentage of
            leveraging, having the lowest interest rate, having the highest
            ratio of 3-5 bedroom units to total units, or located in Empowerment
            Zones/Enterprise Communities or on tribal lands. In addition, the
            Agency may, at its sole discretion, set aside assistance for or rank
            projects that meet important program goals. Assistance will include
            both loan guarantees and interest credits. Priority projects must
            compete for set-aside funds. The Agency will announce any assistance
            set aside and selection criteria in the NOFA.

          A loan guarantee under this part will be evidenced by a Loan Note
          Guarantee issued by the Agency. Each lender will execute a
          Lender&apos;s Agreement. If a valid Lender&apos;s Agreement already
          exists, it is not necessary to execute a new Lender&apos;s Agreement
          with each loan guarantee.

             A guarantee under this part is backed by the full faith and credit
            of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or
            misrepresentation of which the lender had knowledge at the time the
            lender acquired the guarantee or assigned the loan, or in which a
            lender participates or condones. The guarantee will be unenforceable
            by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by a violation of
            usury laws, negligent servicing or origination by the lender,
            including a failure to acquire required security, or as a result of
            a use of loan funds for purposes other than those authorized by the
            Agency. The acts in the previous sentence constitute grounds for the
            refusal to make full payment under the guarantee to the lender, and
            will not be taken until the Agency gives the lender notice of the
            acts or omissions that it considers to constitute such grounds,
            specifying the applicable provisions of the Statute, Regulations,
            Loan Note Guarantee, or Lender&apos;s Agreement; the lender has not
            cured the acts or omissions within 90 calendar days after such
            notice; and the acts or omissions can reasonably be expected to have
            a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the guaranteed
            mortgage or the physical condition of the property securing the
            guaranteed mortgage. If such acts or omissions cannot be cured
            within a 90 calendar day period, the 90 calendar day cure period
            automatically shall be extended so long as curative activities are
            commenced during the 90 calendar day period. At no time shall the
            curative period extend more than 270 calendar days from the
            expiration of the original 90 calendar day cure period. When a
            guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a Holder, the Holder shall
            succeed to all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to
            the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will remain bound to
            all obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender&apos;s
            Agreement, and the Agency program regulations.

          The Agency may refuse to guarantee a loan in an area where there is
          undue risk due to a concentration in the market of properties subject
          to a Agency guaranteed loan. The Agency will consider the credit
          quality of the loan and overall market conditions in making a
          determination of undue risk. If any of the Agency guaranteed loans in
          the market are experiencing vacancy rates in excess of 15% and the
          vacancy is due to market conditions, the Agency will invoke this
          provision and not guarantee the loan.

          statement and required loan documents are in a form acceptable to the

             It is the lender&apos;s responsibility during special servicing to
            make a special effort to ensure that maintenance of the property
            meets Agency requirements and the tenants&apos; rights are
            protected, until such time that the property is liquidated by the
            lender, the loan is paid in full, or the loan is assigned to the
            Agency. The lender must update the Agency monthly until the default
            is cured or a claim is filed. The lender must maintain adequate
            records of any and all efforts to cure the default or to foreclose.

             When special servicing is initiated, the lender must submit for
            Agency review a special servicing plan that includes proposed
            actions to cure the deficiencies and a timeframe for completion. The
            special servicing plan will specify the proposed terms of any
            workout agreement recommended by the lender. The lender must obtain
            Agency approval of the terms of any workout agreement with the
            borrower. The workout agreement may include a loan modification,
            transfer of physical assets, or partial payment of claim and
            reamortization of the loan. Failure to comply with terms contained
            in the executed workout agreement will be considered a default of
            the guaranteed loan.

             The Holder may make written demand on the lender to repurchase the
            unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan when the borrower is in
            default not less than 60 calendar days on principal or interest due
            on the loan; or the lender has failed to remit to the Holder its pro
            rata share of any payment made by the borrower within 30 calendar
            days of receipt by the lender. The Holder must concurrently send a
            copy of the demand letter to the Agency. The lender will notify the
            Holder and the Agency of its decision to repurchase within 10
            business days from the date of the written demand letter by the
            Holder. The lender may agree to repurchase the unpaid portion of the
            entire loan from the Holder, even though the guarantee does not
            cover any unguaranteed portion of the loan held by the Holder. If
            the lender decides to repurchase, the lender has 30 calendar days
            from the date of the Holder&apos;s written demand letter to do so.
            The guarantee does not cover any unguaranteed portion of the loan or
            the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan accruing
            after 90 calendar days from the date of the Holder&apos;s demand
            letter to the lender requesting the repurchase. The lender may

            The lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the

             If the lender does not repurchase the loan as provided in paragraph
            (a) of this section, the Agency will purchase from the Holder the
            unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with
            accrued interest to date of repurchase, less the lender&apos;s
            servicing fee, within 30 calendar days after written demand to the
            Agency from the Holder. The guarantee will not cover the note
            interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90
            calendar days from the date of the original demand letter of the
            Holder to the lender requesting the repurchase. Holders of Loan Note
            Guarantees that have been issued prior to the effective date of this
            final rule may opt to adhere to the terms and conditions of the Loan
            Note Guarantee then in effect. In case of loan default, the Holder
            of a Loan Note Guarantee issued prior to the effective date of this
            final rule will stipulate, in a written demand for repurchase, its
            preference for repurchase in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee
            issued prior to the effective date of this final rule. If the demand
            for repurchase does not stipulate a preference for repurchase in
            accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee issued prior to the
            effective date of this final rule, the Agency will process the
            demand for repurchase as stated in this final rule. The Holder must
            stipulate a preference for repurchase in accordance with the Loan
            Note Guarantee issued prior to the effective date of this final rule
            in the first demand for repurchase. The Holder of the Loan Note
            Guarantee issued prior to the effective date of this final rule
            cannot make a subsequent demand for repurchase changing the
            preference stipulated in the original demand for repurchase.

            the unpaid principal and interest then owed by the borrower on the
            loan and the amount then owed to any Holder. Any discrepancy between

             Filing an estimated loss claim. When the lender is conducting the
            liquidation and owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the
            loan, the lender will file an estimated loss claim with the
            liquidation plan if the lender expects liquidation to exceed 90
            calendar days. The estimated loss payment will be based on the
            outstanding loan amount minus the liquidation value of the
            collateral. For the purpose of reporting and loss claim computation,
            the loss claim will be promptly processed in accordance with
            applicable Agency regulations, as set forth in this section. The
            loss claim calculation will include 90 calendar days of interest
            accrual on the defaulted loan at the time the estimated loss claim
            is paid by the Agency. If the lender estimates that there will be no
            loss after considering the costs of liquidation, the lender submits
            an estimated loss claim of zero. Interest accrual will cease 90
            calendar days after the date the liquidation plan is approved by the
            Agency.

             In the case of a conveyance of title to the property, the lender
            must inform the Agency in advance of how it plans to acquire title
            and a timetable for doing so. The Agency will accept the conveyance
            upon receipt of an assignment to the Agency of all claims of the
            lender against the property and assignment of the lender&apos;s
            rights to any operating funds and any reserves or escrows
            established for the maintenance of the property or the payment of
            property taxes and insurance.

             The Government&apos;s written authorization is required for all
            protective advances in excess of $5,000. Protective advances
            include, but are not limited to, advances made for property taxes,
            annual assessments, ground rent, hazard or flood insurance premiums
            affecting the collateral, and other expenses necessary to preserve
            or protect the security. Attorney fees are not a protective advance.
            A protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the
            final report of loss payment except in certain transfer and
            assumption situations with Agency approval.

            any other information necessary for the successful completion of

            otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation. The
            documentation accompanying the report of loss must support the
