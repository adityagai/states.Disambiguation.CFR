          assessment per hundredweight fixed by the Secretary times the quantity
          of potatoes which he handles as the first handler thereof. At any time
          during or after a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate
          of assessment as necessary to cover authorized expenses. Such increase
          shall be applicable to all potatoes handled during the given fiscal
          period. The payment of expenses for the maintenance and functioning of
          the committee may be required during periods when no regulations are
          in effect. If a handler does not pay his assessment within the time
          prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be increased by a late
          payment charge or an interest charge, or both, at rates prescribed by
          the committee with the approval of the Secretary.

          The Committee shall impose an interest charge on any handler who fails
          to pay his or her assessment within sixty (60) days of the billing
          date shown on the handler&apos;s assessment statement received from
          the Committee. The interest charge shall, after 60 days, be one
          percent of the unpaid assessment balance. In the event the handler
          fails to pay the delinquent assessment, the one percent interest
          charge shall be applied monthly thereafter to the unpaid balance,
          including any accumulated unpaid interest. Any amount paid by a
          handler as an assessment, including any charges imposed pursuant to
          this paragraph, shall be credited when the 
          <PRTPAGE P='316' />
          payment is received in the Committee office.
