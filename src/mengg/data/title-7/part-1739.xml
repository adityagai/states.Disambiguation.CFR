             The provision of broadband transmission service is vital to the
            economic development, education, health, and safety of rural
            Americans. The purpose of the Community Connect Grant Program is to
            provide financial assistance in the form of grants to eligible
            applicants that will provide, on a “community-oriented connectivity”
            basis, broadband transmission service that fosters economic growth
            and delivers enhanced educational, health care, and public safety
            services. The Agency will give priority to rural areas that it
            believes have the greatest need for broadband transmission services,
            based on the criteria contained herein.

             Grant authority will be used for the deployment of broadband
            transmission service to extremely rural, lower-income communities on
            a “community-oriented connectivity” basis. The “community-oriented
            connectivity” concept will stimulate practical, everyday uses and
            applications of broadband by cultivating the deployment of new
            broadband transmission services that improve economic development
            and provide enhanced educational and health care opportunities in
            rural areas. Such an approach will also give rural communities the
            opportunity to benefit from the advanced technologies that are
            necessary to achieve these goals.
