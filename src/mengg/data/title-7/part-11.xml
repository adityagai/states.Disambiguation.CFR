            organization within the Department, subject to the general

            independent from all other agencies and offices of the Department,

            decision and by the agency which issued the adverse decision, are

            determined by the Division most likely to obtain the facts relevant
            to the matter or matters at issue. The Hearing Officer will allow

            or committee of the agency making the adverse decision at the time

            irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, information,
            or questions. Any party shall have the opportunity to present oral
            and documentary evidence, oral testimony of witnesses, and arguments
            in support of the party&apos;s position; controvert evidence relied
            on by any other party; and question all witnesses. When appropriate,
            agency witnesses requested by the appellant will be made available
            at the hearing. Any evidence may be received by the Hearing Officer
            without regard to whether that evidence could be admitted in
            judicial proceedings.

            Hearing Officer using the agency record, the hearing record, the
            request for review, any responses submitted under paragraph (c) of

            accepted by the Director, in order to determine whether the decision
            of the Hearing Officer is supported by substantial evidence. Based
            on such review, the Director will issue a final determination notice
            that upholds, reverses, or modifies the determination of the Hearing
            Officer. The Director&apos;s determination upon review of a Hearing
            Officer&apos;s decision shall be considered to be the final
            determination under this part and shall not be appealable. However,
            if the Director determines that the hearing record is inadequate or
            that new evidence has been submitted, the Director may remand all or
            a portion of the determination to the Hearing Officer for further
            proceedings to complete the hearing record or, at the option of the
            Director, to hold a new hearing.

        <P>
          In two situations, parties other than the appellant or the agency may
          be interested in participating in Division proceedings. In the first
          situation, a Division proceeding may in fact result in the
          adjudication of the rights of a third party, e.g., an appeal of a
          tenant involving a payment shared with a landlord, an appeal by one
          recipient of a portion of a payment shared by multiple parties, an
          appeal by one heir of an estate. In the second situation, a party may
          desire to receive notice of and perhaps participate in an appeal
          because of the derivative impact the appeal determination will have on
          that party, e.g., guaranteed lenders and reinsurance companies. The
          provisions in this section set forth rules for the participation of
          such third and interested parties.

             When an appeal is filed, the Division shall notify any potential
            third party whose rights may be adjudicated of its right to
            participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the right
            to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination. Such
            third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an
            agency, or by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one
            notice to the third party of its right to participate, and if such
            party declines to participate, the Division determination will be
            binding as to that third party as if it had participated. For
            purposes of 
            <PRTPAGE P='372' />
            this part, a third party includes any party for which a
            determination of the Division could lead to an agency action on
            implementation that would be adverse to the party thus giving such
            party a right to a Division appeal.

             A request must reasonably describe records to enable NAD personnel
            to locate them with reasonable effort. Where possible, a requester
            should supply specific information, such as dates, titles, appellant
            name or appeal number, that may help identify the records. If the
            request relates to a matter in pending litigation, the court and its
            location should be identified.
