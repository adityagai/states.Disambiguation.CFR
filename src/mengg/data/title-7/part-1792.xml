             et seq.) was enacted to reduce risks to life and property through
            the establishment and maintenance of an effective earthquake hazards
            reduction program (the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
            or NEHRP). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is
            designated as the agency with the primary responsibilities to plan
            and coordinate the NEHRP. This program includes the development and
            implementation of feasible design and construction methods to make
            structures earthquake resistant. Executive Order 12699 of January 5,
            1990, Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated
            New Building Construction (3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 269), requires that
            measures to assure seismic safety be imposed on federally assisted
            new building construction.
