          A California Olive Committee consisting of 16 members, is hereby
          established to administer the terms and provisions of this part. Each
          member shall have an alternate who meets the same qualifications as
          the member. Eight of the members and their alternates shall be
          producers or officers or employees of producers, and eight of the
          members and their alternates shall be handlers or directors, officers,
          or employees of handlers. The eight members of the committee who are
          producers or officers or employees of producers are referred to in
          this subpart as “producer members” of the committee; and the eight
          members of the committee who are handlers or directors, officers, or
          employees of handlers are referred to in this subpart as “handler
          members” of the committee. The committee may be increased by one
          public member who shall not be a producer or handler of olives nor an
          officer or employee or director of any producer or handler of olives.
          District representation of the producer members shall be two from
          District 1, four from District 2, and two from District 3. Allocation
          of the handler members shall be four members to represent cooperative
          marketing organizations, herein referred to as “cooperative handlers”,
          and four members to represent handlers who are not cooperative
          marketing organizations, herein referred to as “independent handlers”:

           That whenever during the crop year in which nominations are made and
          in the preceding crop year, the cooperative handlers or the
          independent handlers handled as first handler 65 percent or more of
          the total quantity of olives so handled by all handlers, allocation
          shall be five members to represent the group which so handled 65
          percent or more of such olives and three members to represent the
          group which handled 35 percent or less. The public member and
          alternate public member shall be selected from any place within the
          area. The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, provide
          such other allocation of producer or handler membership, or both, as
          may be necessary to assure equitable representation.

        <P>
          Decisions of the committee shall be by majority vote of the members
          present and voting, and a quorum must be present: 
          <E T='03'>
            Provided,
          </E>
           That decisions requiring a recommendation to the Secretary on matters
          pertaining to grade and size regulations shall require at least 10
          affirmative votes, at least 5 of which must be from producer members
          and at least 5 of which must be from handler members and, if the
          committee is increased by the addition of a public member, at least 11
          affirmative votes shall be required, at least 5 of which must be from
          producer members and at least 5 of which must be from handler members.
          A quorum shall consist of at least 10 members of whom at least 5 shall
          be producer members and at least 5 shall be handler members and, if
          the committee is increased by the addition of a public member, a
          quorum shall consist of at least 11 members of which at least 5 shall
          be producer members and at least 5 shall be handler members. Except in
          case of an emergency, a minimum of 5 days advance notice shall be
          given with respect to any meeting of the committee. In case of an
          emergency, to be determined within the discretion of the chairman of
          the committee, as much advance notice of a meeting as is practicable
          in the circumstances shall be given. The committee may vote by mail or
          telegram upon due notice to all members, but any proposition to be so
          voted upon first shall be explained accurately, fully, and identically
          by mail or telegram to all members. When voted on by such method, at
          least 14 affirmative votes, of which seven shall be producer member
          votes and seven shall be handler member votes, shall be required for
          adoption and, if the committee is increased by the addition of a
          public member, votes by mail or telegram shall require at least 15
          affirmative votes, of which at least 7 shall be producer member votes
          and at least 7 shall be handler member votes. The committee may
          recommend for the Secretary&apos;s approval changes in the number of
          affirmative votes required for adoption of any proposition voted upon
          by means of a mail or telegram ballot: 
          <E T='03'>
            Provided,
          </E>
           That the number of affirmative votes required for adoption shall not
          be less than ten, and in any case an equal number of producer member
          and handler member votes shall be required for adoption and, if the
          committee is increased by the addition of a public member, the number
          of affirmative votes required for adoption shall be increased by one.

             The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may provide for
            crediting a portion of a handler&apos;s direct expenditures for paid
            brand advertising for olives. Such expenditures may include, but are

            newspapers, outdoor media and transit or time charges for radio and
            television. No handler shall receive credit in excess of such
            handler&apos;s pro rata share of the total monies allotted by the

          At least 14 days prior to the start of each crop year (except that
          this period may be shortened by the committee 
          <PRTPAGE P='252' />
          not more than 5 days if warranted), the committee shall hold a meeting

           That with respect to the 1982-83 crop year the committee shall hold a
          meeting for such purpose as soon as practicable. The committee shall
          prepare and submit to the Secretary promptly after each such meeting,
          a report setting forth its recommended marketing policy for the
          ensuing crop year. In the event it becomes advisable to modify such
          policy, because of changed supply, demand, or other conditions, the
          committee shall formulate a new policy and shall submit a report
          thereon to the Secretary. In developing the marketing policy, the
          committee shall give consideration to the handler carryover,
          production, probable quality and composition of olive sizes in the
          crop, trade demand, probable imports, whether producer prices are
          likely to exceed parity, the probable assessable tonnage and such
          other factors as may have a bearing on the marketing of olives or the
          administration of this part. Notice of the committee&apos;s marketing
          policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be given promptly by
          reasonable publicity to producers and handlers.

            of packaged olives contrary to a previously approved application.
