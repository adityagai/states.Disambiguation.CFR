          The purpose of the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Loan and
          Grant Program is to encourage and improve telemedicine services and
          distance learning services in rural areas through the use of
          telecommunications, computer networks, and related advanced
          technologies by students, teachers, medical professionals, and rural
          residents. This subpart describes the general policies for
          administering the DLT program. Subpart E contains the policies and
          procedures related to grants; subpart F contains the policies and
          procedures related to a combination loan and grant; and subpart G
          contains the policies and procedures related to loans.

             The transmission of information is vital to the economic
            development, education, and health of rural Americans. To further
            this objective, RUS will provide financial assistance to distance
            learning and telemedicine projects that will improve the access of
            people residing in rural areas to educational, learning, training,
            and health care services.

             In providing financial assistance, RUS will give priority to rural
            areas that it believes have the greatest need for distance learning
            and telemedicine services. RUS believes that generally the need is
            greatest in areas that are economically challenged, costly to serve,
            and experiencing outward migration. This program is consistent with
            the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that designate
            telecommunications service discounts for schools, libraries, and
            rural health care centers. RUS will take into consideration the
            community&apos;s involvement in the proposed project and the
            applicant&apos;s ability to leverage grant funds.

            complete the project without a grant. RUS will also consider the
            extent to which the applicant provides evidence that economic,
            education, or health care challenges could not be addressed without
            employing advanced technology. The Administrator will also consider
            any support by recognized experts in the related educational or
            health care field, any documentation substantiating the educational
            or health care underserved nature of the applicant&apos;s proposed

             This criterion will be used to evaluate the relative financial need
            of the applicant, community, and project. All applicants are
            required to provide the applicable percentage of students eligible
            to participate in the NSLP for each area to be served by the end
            user site. The appropriate State or local organization administering
            the program must certify the percentages as being correct. The
            applicant must provide RUS with a listing of the location of each
            end user site (city, town, village, borough or rural area plus the
            State) discussing how the appropriate NSLP percentage was determined
            in accordance with this section. These percentages may be obtained
            from the State or local organization that administers the program
            and must be certified by that organization as being correct. For
            purposes of this subpart, the NSLP percentage will reflect the
            percentage of eligibility rather than the percentage of actual
            participation.

          All qualifying applications under this subpart will be scored based on
          the criteria contained in

          . Awards will be made by RUS based on the highest ranking applications
          and the amount of financial assistance available for grants. All
          applicants will be notified in writing of the score each application
          receives, and included in this notification will be a tentative
          minimum required score to receive financial assistance. If the score
          received by the applicant could result in the denial of its
          application, or if its score, while apparently sufficient to qualify
          for financial assistance, may be surpassed by the score awarded to a
          competing application after appeal, that applicant may appeal its
          numerical scoring. Any appeal must be based on inaccurate scoring of
          the application by RUS and no new information or data that was not
          included in the original application will be considered. The appeal
          must be made, in writing, within 10 days after the applicant is
          notified of the scoring results. Appeals shall be submitted to the
          Administrator, RUS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence
          Ave., SW., STOP 1590, Washington, DC 20250-1590. Thereafter, the
          Administrator will review the original scoring to determine whether to
          sustain, reverse, or modify the original scoring determination. Final
          determinations will be made after consideration of all appeals. The
          Administrator&apos;s determination will be final. A copy of the
          Administrator&apos;s decision will be furnished promptly to the
          applicant.

             RUS will determine, from the information submitted with each
            application for a combination loan and grant, whether the
            application achieves sufficient priority, based on the criteria set
            forth in the 1996 Act, to receive a combination loan and grant from
            funds available for the fiscal year. If such priority is achieved,
            RUS will process the combination loan and grant application on a
            first-in, first-out basis, provided that the total amount of
            applications on-hand for combination loans and grants does not
            exceed 90 percent of the total loan and grant funding available for
            the fiscal year. At such time as the total amount of applications
            eligible for combination loans and grants, if such applications were
            approved, exceeds 90 percent of amount of combination loan and grant
            funding available, RUS will process the remaining applications using

            application for a loan, whether the application achieves sufficient
            priority, based on the criteria set forth in the 1996 Act, to
            receive a loan from funds available for the fiscal year. If such
            priority is achieved, RUS will process the loan application on a
            first-in, first-out basis, provided that the total amount of
            applications on-hand for loans does not exceed 90 percent of the
            total loan funding available for the fiscal year. At such time as
            the total amount of applications eligible for loans, if such
            applications were approved, exceeds 90 percent of amount of loan
            funding available, RUS will process the remaining applications using

          The deferment of loan payments may be granted to any borrower that is
          not financially distressed, delinquent on any Federal debt, or in
          bankruptcy proceedings. However, the deferment of loan payments will
          not be granted to a borrower during any period in which the
          Administrator has determined that no additional financial assistance
          of any nature should be provided to the borrower pursuant to any
          provision of the RE Act. The determination to suspend eligibility for
          the deferment of loan payments under this subpart will be based on:

        <P>
          The deferment of loan payments will be made to enable the borrower to
          provide funding and assistance for rural development and job creation
          projects. This includes, but is not limited to, the borrower providing
          financing to local businesses, community development assistance,
          technical assistance to businesses, and other community, business, or
          economic development projects that will benefit rural areas.

          Prospective recipients of funds received from the deferment of loan
          payments are encouraged to consider the potential environmental impact

          development in a manner that reduces, to the extent practicable, the
          potential to affect the quality of the human environment adversely.

          Borrowers shall ensure that funds are invested in the rural
          development project as approved by RUS. The Administrator reserves the
          right to review the books and copy records of borrowers receiving loan
          payment deferments as necessary to ensure that the investments in the
          rural development project are in accordance with this subpart and the
          representations and purposes stated in the borrower&apos;s completed
          application. If an audit discloses that the amount deferred was not
          used for the purposes stated in the completed application, the
          borrower shall be required to promptly repay the amount deferred and
          the benefits of the deferment to the borrower will be recaptured by
          RUS. The borrower is responsible for ensuring that disbursements and
          expenditures of funds covering the investment in the rural development
          project are properly supported with certifications, invoices,
          contracts, bills of sale, cancelled checks, or any other forms of
          evidence determined appropriate by the Administrator and that such
          supporting material is available at the borrower&apos;s premises for
          review by the RUS field accountant, borrower&apos;s certified public
          accountant, the Office of Inspector General, the General Accounting
          Office and any other accountant conducting an audit of the
          borrower&apos;s financial statements for this rural development
          program.
