             The County Supervisor will encourage each borrower to pay taxes
            promptly in order to avoid any penalties. Normally, this can be
            accomplished through routine servicing of loans by emphasizing the
            advantages of setting aside sufficient income to meet tax
            obligations when they become due. Taxes will be adequately budgeted
            for those borrowers with whom Form FmHA or its successor agency
            under

             431-2, “Farm and Home Plan,” is developed. Each borrower will be
            encouraged to notify the County Supervisor when he has paid his
            taxes. After the delinquent date, it will be necessary for the
            County Supervisor to determine the borrowers whose taxes are
            delinquent. The Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS) will
            be used in posting servicing actions on delinquent taxes.

             The County Supervisor will contact each borrower with a delinquent
            tax and make every practical effort to have him pay the tax with his
            own funds. He will use the Management System Card for follow-up of
            delinquent taxes. If the delinquent tax is not paid and the borrower
