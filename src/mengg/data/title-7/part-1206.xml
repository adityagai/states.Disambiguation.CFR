             At least once every five years, the Board will review the
            geographical distribution of production of mangos in the United
            States, the geographical distribution of the importation of mangos
            into the United States, the quantity of mangos produced in the
            United States, and the quantity of mangos imported into the United
            States. The review will be based on Board assessment records and
            statistics from the Department. If warranted, the Board will
            recommend to the Department that membership on the Board be altered
            to reflect any changes in geographical distribution of domestic
            mango production and importation and the quantity of domestic
            production and imports. To ensure equitable representation,
            additional first handlers may be added to the Board to reflect
            increases in domestic production.

            </aref>
            ) and who is not a split operation shall be exempt from the payment
            of assessments. That importer may submit documentation to the Board
            and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent organic
            mangos—on a form provided by the Board—at any time initially and
            annually thereafter on or before the beginning of the fiscal period
            as long as the importer continues to be eligible for the exemption.
            This documentation shall include the same information required of
            first handlers in paragraph (c). If the importer complies with the
            requirements of this section, the Board will grant the exemption and
            issue a Certificate of Exemption to the importer within the
            applicable timeframe. The Board will also issue the importer a
            9-digit alphanumeric Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification
            valid for 1 year from the date of issue. This HTS classification
            should be entered by the importer on the Customs entry
            documentation. Any line item entry of 100 percent organic mangos
            bearing this HTS classification assigned by the Board will not be
            subject to assessments.
