             This part sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the
            donation of commodities by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) of
            the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to participants in the
            McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition
            Program (McGovern-Dole Program). Under the McGovern-Dole Program,
            participants use the donated commodities, proceeds from the sale of
            such commodities, or funds provided by FAS to implement activities
            in a foreign country pursuant to an agreement with FAS. FAS
            administers the McGovern-Dole Program and acts on behalf of the
            Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in cases where the agreement is
            funded with CCC resources.

            general application issued by the Department, including the
            regulations set forth in Chapter 30 of this title, are applicable to
            the McGovern-Dole Program. In cases where an agreement is funded
            with CCC resources, provisions of the CCC Charter Act (
