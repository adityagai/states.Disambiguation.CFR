          Cooperative river basin studies provide USDA planning assistance to
          Federal, State, and local governments. The purpose of these studies is
          to assist in appraising water and related land resources; defining and
          determining the extent of the problems; and formulating alternative
          plans, including land treatment, nonstructural or structural measures,
          or combinations thereof, that would solve existing problems or meet
          existing and projected needs. These studies concentrate on specific
          objectives identified by the requesting agencies and citizen groups
          that are consistent with USDA authorities and responsibilities and
          current NRCS priorities. The objectives ordinarily include the
          formulation of a plan but may require only inventories of available
          resources and associated problems to be used by other agencies in plan
          
          <PRTPAGE P='468' />
          formulation. USDA assistance is provided through field advisory
          committees composed of representatives of the Economic Research
          Service, Forest Service, and NRCS. The NRCS representative chairs the
          field advisory committee.

          Assistance is available to conservation districts, communities. county
          governments, regional planning boards, other planning groups, and
          State and Federal agencies. Local groups express their desires for a
          cooperative study to the governor or appropriate State agency.

        <P>
          For a cooperative study a governor, or a Federal, State, or local
          government agency must submit a written request and a Proposal to
          Study (PTS) through the NRCS State Conservationist to the Chief.
          Assistance in preparing the proposal may be obtained by contacting the
          State Conservationist. The State Conservationist sends the request and
          proposal with comments to the Chief for consideration. The proposal
          should:

          The Chief may authorize requested cooperative studies recommended by
          the State Conservationist. Priority for starting cooperative studies
          is based on the date of application, the readiness of the requesting
          agency to begin participation, the importance and significance of
          problems to be studied, the monetary or in-kind contributions toward
          the study, the sequence of ongoing and future studies, the type of
          study, the duration of study, the cost of study, the potential for
          implementation and other factors affecting the effectiveness and
          efficiency of the study. The number and location of cooperative
          studies started each year are governed by the availability of USDA
          funds and personnel.

          Floodplain management studies provide needed information and
          assistance to local and State entities so that they can implement
          programs for reducing existing and future flood damages in rural and
          urban communities. Assistance is targeted to communities where flood
          damage is a serious concern and local governments are sincerely
          interested in taking action to reduce damage.

             A study for an individual community may be started upon completion
            of a plan of work in which the Director of the Basin and Area
            Planning Division concurs and for which funds are available.
            Preparation of the plan of work is the responsibility of and must be
            approved by the applicant, the responsible State agency, and the
            State Conservationist. The plan sets forth the responsibilities of
            the applicant, the State, and USDA in carrying out the study and
            interpreting and using the data in a local floodplain management
            program. The State agency responsible for floodplain management
            activities may establish priorities on which to base the sequence of
            approval of floodplain management studies within its State. The
            number of studies started each Federal fiscal year is governed by
            the availability of funds and personnel and the amount of State and
            local assistance available.

          As requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and
          within the limits of available resources, NRCS carries out flood
          insurance studies of various types under the National Flood Insurance
          Program (Pub. L. 90-448, 82 Statute, 574 (

          )), as amended. In this activity, NRCS performs detailed technical
          studies to determine the extent and frequency of flooding. The flood
          insurance program is administered by FEMA. NRCS is reimbursed by that
          agency for actual costs incurred in carrying out the studies. Local
          entities desiring flood insurance coverage should contact the
          responsible State agency or FEMA and apply in accordance with
          procedures of that agency.
