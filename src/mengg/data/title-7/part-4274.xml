             The purpose of the program is to alleviate poverty and increase
            economic activity and employment in rural communities, especially
            disadvantaged and remote communities, through financing targeted
            primarily towards smaller and emerging businesses, in partnership
            with other public and private resources, and in accordance with
            State and regional strategy based on identified community needs.
            This purpose is achieved through loans made to intermediaries that
            establish programs for the purpose of providing loans to ultimate
            recipients for business facilities and community developments in a
            rural area.

             Initial security will consist of a pledge by the intermediary of
            all assets now in or hereafter placed in the IRP revolving fund,
            including cash and investments, notes receivable from ultimate
            recipients, and the intermediary&apos;s security interest in
            collateral pledged by ultimate recipients. Except for good cause
            shown, the Agency will not obtain assignments of specific assets at
            the time a loan is made to an intermediary or ultimate recipient.
            The intermediary will covenant that, in the event the
            intermediary&apos;s financial condition deteriorates or the
            intermediary takes action detrimental to prudent fund operation or
            fails to take action required of a prudent lender, the intermediary
            will provide additional security, execute any additional documents,

            asset, including physical delivery of assets and specific
            assignments to the Agency. All debt instruments and collateral
            documents used by an intermediary in connection with loans to

             For as long as any part of an IRP loan to an intermediary remains

            Agency IRP loan funds received by an intermediary 
            <PRTPAGE P='778' />
            must be deposited into an IRP revolving fund. The intermediary may
            transfer additional assets into the IRP revolving fund. All cash of
            the IRP revolving fund shall be deposited in a separate bank account
            or accounts. No other funds of the intermediary will be commingled
            with such money. All moneys deposited in such bank account or
            accounts shall be money of the IRP revolving fund. Loans to ultimate
            recipients are advanced from the IRP revolving fund. The receivables
            created by making loans to ultimate recipients, the
            intermediary&apos;s security interest in collateral pledged by
            ultimate recipients, collections on the receivables, interest, fees,
            and any other income or assets derived from the operation of the IRP
            revolving fund are a part of the IRP revolving fund.

             If an intermediary receives more than one IRP loan, it need not

            loan; it may combine them and maintain only one IRP revolving fund,
            unless the Agency requires separate IRP revolving funds because
            there are significant differences in the loan purposes, work plans,
            loan agreements, or requirements for the loans. The Agency may allow
            loans with different requirements to be combined into one IRP
            revolving fund if the intermediary agrees in writing to operate the
            combined revolving funds in accordance with the most stringent
            requirements as required by the Agency.

             The IRP is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which
            requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local
            officials. The approval of a loan to an intermediary will be the
            subject of intergovernmental consultation. For each ultimate
            recipient to be assisted with a loan from Agency IRP loan funds and
            for which the State in which the ultimate recipient is to be located
            has elected to review the program under their intergovernmental
            review process, the State Single Point of Contact must be notified.
            Notification, in the form of a project description, must be
            initiated by the intermediary or the ultimate recipient. Any 
            <PRTPAGE P='779' />
            comments from the State must be included with the
            intermediary&apos;s request to use the Agency loan funds for the
            ultimate recipient. Prior to the Agency&apos;s decision on the
            request, compliance with the requirements of intergovernmental
            consultation must be demonstrated for each ultimate recipient. These
            requirements are set forth in U.S. Department of Agriculture
            regulations

            , subpart G, of this title apply to this subpart. Intermediaries and
            ultimate recipients must consider the potential environmental
            impacts of their projects at the earliest planning stages and
            develop plans to minimize the potential to adversely impact the
            environment. Both the intermediaries and the ultimate recipients
            must cooperate and furnish such information and assistance as the
            Agency needs to make any of its environmental determinations.

             For each application for an initial loan to an intermediary, the
            Agency will review the application, supporting materials, and any
            environmental information required from the intermediary and
            complete a Class II environmental assessment. This assessment will
            focus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projects as well as
            any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with
            individual projects that can be identified at this time. Neither the
            completion of the environmental assessment nor the approval of the
            application is an Agency commitment to the use of loan funds for a
            specific project; therefore, no public notification requirements for
            a Class II assessment will apply to the application. An application
            for a subsequent loan to an intermediary may be considered a
            categorical exclusion for environmental review, rather than a Class
            II action, provided the service area, eligibility requirements, and
            eligible purposes for loans to ultimate recipients will be the same
            for the subsequent loan as were considered in the previous
            environmental assessment, and the purpose of the loan is not
            environmentally controversial.

            application for a loan from Agency IRP loan funds determined to have
            a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

             Reports will be required quarterly during the first year after loan
            closing and, if all loan funds are not utilized during the first

            of the Agency IRP loan funds have been advanced to ultimate
            recipients. Thereafter, reports will be required semiannually. Also,
            the Agency may require quarterly reports if the intermediary becomes

            delaying cancellation of the funds by not more than 3 additional
            years. If any loan funds have not been used by 6 years from the date

            regular loan payments will be based on the amount of funds actually
            drawn by the intermediary.

            service area with severe economic problems, such as communities that
            have remained persistently poor over the last 60 years or have
            experienced long-term population decline or job deterioration; a
            service area with emergency conditions caused by a natural disaster
            or loss of a major industry; a work plan that is in accord with a
            strategic plan, particularly a plan prepared as part of a request
            for an Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community designation; or
            excellent utilization of a previous IRP loan.

          If the Agency is able to make the loan, it will provide the
          intermediary a letter of conditions listing all requirements for the
          loan. Immediately after reviewing the conditions and requirements in
          the letter of conditions, the intermediary should complete, sign and
          return the form provided by the Agency indicating the
          intermediary&apos;s intent to meet the conditions. If certain
          conditions cannot be met, the intermediary may propose alternate
          conditions to the Agency. The Agency loan approval official must
          concur with any changes made to the initially issued or proposed
          letter of conditions prior to acceptance.
