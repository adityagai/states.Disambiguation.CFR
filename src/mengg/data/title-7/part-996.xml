             Each lot of shelled or cleaned inshell peanuts intended for human
            consumption shall be identified by positive lot identification prior
            to being shipped or otherwise disposed of. Positive lot
            identification (PLI) methods are tailored to the size and
            containerization of the lot, by warehouse storage or space
            requirements, or, by necessary further movement of the lot prior to
            certification. Positive lot identification is established by the
            Inspection Service and includes the following methods of
            identification. For domestic lots and repackaged import lots, PLI
            includes PLI stickers, tags or seals applied to each individual
            package or container in such a manner that is acceptable to the
            Inspection Service and maintains the identity of the lot. For
            imported lots, PLI tape may be used to wrap bags or boxes on
            pallets, PLI stickers may be used to cover the shrink-wrap overlap,
            doors may be sealed to isolate the lot, bags or boxes may be
            stenciled with a lot number, or any other means that is acceptable
            to the Inspection Service. The crop year or quota year shown on the
            positive lot identification tags shall be the year in which the
            peanuts in the lot were produced domestically or imported into the
            U.S., as appropriate. All lots of 
            <PRTPAGE P='681' />
            shelled and cleaned-inshell peanuts shall be handled, stored, and
            shipped under positive lot identification procedures, except those

            shelled peanuts intended for human consumption to be drawn by the
            Inspection Service. The gross amount of peanuts drawn shall be large
            enough to provide for a grade analysis, for a grading check-sample,
            and for three 48-pound samples for aflatoxin chemical analysis. The
            three 48-pound samples shall be designated by the Inspection Service
            as “Sample 1,” “Sample 2,” and “Sample 3” and each sample shall be
            placed in a suitable container and positive lot identified by means

            immediate testing or Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3 may be
            returned to the handler or importer for testing at a later date.
            Imported peanuts shall be labeled “Sample 1IMP,” “Sample 2IMP,” and
            “Sample 3IMP” and handled accordingly.

             Before shipment of a lot of shelled peanuts to a buyer, the handler

            Service, a USDA laboratory or a USDA-approved laboratory, in a
            “subsampling mill.” The resultant ground subsample from Sample 1
            shall be of a size specified by the Inspection Service and shall be
            designated as “Subsample 1-AB” and at the handler&apos;s,
            importer&apos;s or buyer&apos;s option, a second subsample may also
            be extracted from Sample 1. It shall be designated as “Subsample

            buyer, for aflatoxin assay, to a USDA laboratory or USDA-approved
            laboratory that can provide analyses results on such samples in 36
            hours. The cost of sampling and testing Subsample 1-CD shall be for
            the account of the applicant. Subsample 1-AB shall be analyzed only
            in a USDA laboratory or USDA-approved laboratory. Both Subsamples
            1-AB and 1-CD shall be accompanied by a notice of sampling or grade
            certificate, signed by the inspector, containing, at least,
            identifying information as to the handler or importer, the buyer, if
            known, and the positive lot identification of the shelled peanuts.

             Any “holder of the title” to any lot of peanuts may request an
            appeal inspection if it is believed that the original aflatoxin test
            results were in error. Appeal inspections would be conducted in
            accordance with Federal or Federal-State inspection procedures for
            milled peanuts. The aflatoxin appeal sample would be drawn by
            Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service officials and the appeal
            analysis would be conducted by USDA or USDA-approved laboratories.
            Any financially interested person may request an appeal inspection
            if it is believed that the original quality inspection is in error.
            Quality appeals would be conducted by Federal or Federal-State
            Inspection Service inspectors in accordance with the Federal or
            Federal-State inspection procedures for milled peanuts. The person
            requesting the appeal inspection would pay the cost of such appeals.
            The appeal inspection results shall be issued to the person
            requesting the appeal inspection and a copy shall be mailed to USDA
            or its agent.
