(a) In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may, for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in districts subject to volume regulation (Northwest Michigan, Central Michigan, New York, and Utah) who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries.
