In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Michigan Board in California may, for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in districts subject to volume regulation who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries.
